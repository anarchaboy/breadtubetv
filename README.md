# [BreadTube.tv](https://breadtube.tv)

This project aims to list anti-establishment public YouTubers for simplified onboarding of new members to the cause.

[Check out the announcement on r/breadtube to follow the discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/BreadTube/comments/ahxwrm/breadtubetv_is_live_and_open_source_you_can_help/).

Growing from this base we want to build a platform which elevates content creators far beyond what YouTube can currently offer, and gives them resiliance from being censored or deplatformed.

For now though this is a *_really simple_* website

- Channels can be added to the homepage under `data/channels.yml`
- Videos can be added to the homepage under `data/channels.yml`
- Playlists can be created to link to videos and channels
- Social media can be changed in`config.toml`.

We'd like to simplify the process for adding content, [this is a project you can help with](https://github.com/breadtubetv/breadtubetv/issues/22)!
