The video particularly deals with the character-driven nihilism of Rick and Morty before moving on to nihilism not bound by individual characters, but instead of elements surrounding them. My intentions with this video is twofold. One, I wish to entertain my viewers. Two, I wish to educate people on what to notice when analysing a piece of TV or cinema philosophically. Nihilism in media isn't confined to the existential kind. It's hard to define precisely as the term has had a muddy past. Instead, it leans up against a philosophical/philosophy movement like postmodernism, although there are key differences between the two.",
