  Welcome to this Wisecrack Edition on The Philosophy of Get Out. There are few films
  as clever in their depiction of racial tensions in America as Jordan Peele’s social
  thriller Get Out. While most movies that focus on race take aim at those who overtly
  try to disenfranchise minorities, Get Out does something unique: it explores how
  the demeanor of white liberals who have supposedly “moved beyond racism” may not
  be as authentic as they may think. By drawing on black thinkers and philosophers,
  we explore how Get Out is a masterful depiction of the black condition in 20th Century
  America. === Get the Movie! === Digital Download ► http://amzn.to/2pHg8rM DVD/Blu-ray
