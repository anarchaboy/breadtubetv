  Troopers is a hard film to pin down. Some say it''s an obvious satirical takedown
  or militaristic fascism. Others say a straightforward interpretation suggesting
  the film is earnestly pro-fascist isn''t necessarily wrong. So, which is it? In
  this Wisecrack Edition, we''ll study the powerful incredibly nuanced political philosophy
  of this sci-fi cult classic. === Watch More Episodes! === DJANGO UNCHAINED: How
