  It''s hard to imagine that just a few years ago, Prometheus was positioned to kickstart
  a whole new Alien franchise. But after its less-than-stellar reviews, and the poor
  boxoffice return of Alien Covenant, chances are we''ll never see anther installment.
  One of the biggest criticisms leveled against these films is that they fumble around
  with profound questions, but ultimately fail to address them in any substantial
  way. But is this really the case? Find out in this Wisecrack Edition, where we''ll
  answer the question plaguing all Ridley Scott fans: are these films deep or dumb?
