  to this Wisecrack Edition on one of the most philosophically complex animated films
  of all time: Ghost in the Shell. Through the lens of legendary philosopher Georg
  Hegel, we’ll examine how Ghost in the Shell not only laid a foundation for decades
  of sci-fi to come, but presents us with a truly fresh and original take on the next
  step of human evolution. Whereas most films that explore the line between human
  and machine require one side to triumph over the other, Ghost in the Shell suggests
  something radically different. === More Episodes! === Philosophy of ATTACK ON TITAN
