  ►► http://wscrk.com/SbscrbWC Social Media has made it so that everything we do is
  permanently on record, and because of that, we all have to be careful with what
  we do and what we say online. Mistakes made in the past are looked at through the
  lens of the present, and people are more self-aware than ever about how past injustices
  affect their current situations. Season 21 Episode 3 of South Park presents a clever
  critique of social activism in our social media saturated lives. === More on South
