  Welcome to this Wisecrack Edition on The Philosophy of Fallout 4, where we explore
  many of the political themes from previous installments, plus a new philosophical
  question with the introduction of Synths to the world of the wasteland: What does
  it mean to be human? Drawing from philosopher Donna Haraway’s essay “A Cyborg Manifesto,”
  we discuss the ramifications of how we define what is “human” – both in the Wasteland,
  and in our own world. Get the Game! ►► http://amzn.to/2gLgrg2 === More Episodes!
