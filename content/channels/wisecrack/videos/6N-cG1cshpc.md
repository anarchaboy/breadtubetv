  Press Start for "Is It WRONG If You Don''t Vote?” by 8-Bit Philosophy, where classic
  video games introduce famous thinkers, problems, concepts, and more. In this episode,
  we reflect on the question of VOTING – specifically how present-day election cycles
  may ask us to forgo many of our core values in order to support the lesser of two
  evils. === More Episodes! === Does POLITICAL CORRECTNESS WORK? ► http://wscrk.com/DsPCWk8B
