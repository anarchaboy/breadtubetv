  Check out our Podcasts ► http://wscrk.com/casts The first season of True Detective
  is well known for engaging with pessimist themes, but the philosophy of pessimism
  goes beyond just the ramblings of Rust Cohle. It permeates the very fabric of the
  show - woven into its aesthetics, its references to other works, and even its missteps.
