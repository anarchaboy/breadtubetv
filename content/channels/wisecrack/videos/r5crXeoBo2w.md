  “Nothing is True. Everything is Permitted.” If you’re an Assassin’s Creed fan like
  us, you’ve probably heard this phrase parroted by the Assassin’s Order numerous
  times. Does this motto reveal something essential about the Assassins'' ideology?
  Or is it just deliberately cryptic nonsense? In this Wisecrack Edition, we dive
  in to the book from which the mantra was lifted, Vladimir Bartol’s 1939 novel Alamut,
  to explore how the philosophical backbone of this classic translated to the Assassin’s
  Creed franchise in a rather confusing manner. This questionable handling of philosophical
  material isn’t enough to hurt the games, but it ends up REALLY hurting the movie.
