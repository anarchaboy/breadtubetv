  ►► http://wscrk.com/SbscrbWC Blade Runner is one of the richest sci-fi films in
  cinema history, so following up on such a classic is a daunting challenge. Luckily,
  the new anime that bridges Blade Runner and its forthcoming sequel flexes all the
  brains that made the original so legendary. On this Wisecrack Quick Take, we’re
  gonna break down the core symbolism and philosophical ideas of the original film
  and see how they also manifest in Shinichiro Watanabe’s new anime, Blade Runner
  Blackout 2022. === More Wisecrack === Hidden Meaning in Blade Runner ► http://wscrk.com/1Tk57cX
