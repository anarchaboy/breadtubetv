  The first three seasons of BoJack Horseman showed us a protagonist that, despite
  his Hollywoo success, struggled to find meaning. Season 4 departs from this narrative,
  to focus on... well, narrative. Join us on this Wisecrack Quick Take as we break
  down how our tendency to define ourselves through stories serves as the thematic
  backbone for the newest season of that show starring the horse from Horsin'' Around.
