  Welcome to this Wisecrack Edition on Batman v Superman: What Went Wrong? It’s no
  secret that BvS has drawn widespread ire for its issues with plot and tone. So,
  in an effort not to dwell on the same issues, we decided to focus on another problem
  plaguing the film: its ideological failings. Many of the film’s cues are taken straight
  from Frank Miller’s graphic novel The Dark Knight Returns – a work that paints a
  very clear philosophical divide between Batman and Superman. But it''s in replicating
  this dynamic that BvS starts to flounder. By exploring some of Miller’s key inspirations,
  we’ll unveil how the philosophical backbone of The Dark Knight Returns was adapted
  to Batman v Superman – with lackluster results. Support Wisecrack on Patreon! ►►
