  to this special Wisecrack Edition on the must-know references in Rick and Morty.
  From Freddy Krueger to Zardoz, Rick and Morty pays homage to the imagery and themes
  of pop culture''s most beloved properties – often inverting them to communicate
  something new. The more of these references you know and understand, the richer
  the show becomes! So what are the most important of these references? How do they
  elevate the show to new levels? Join us as we dive in! MASSIVE thanks to LAZERHAWK
  for once again providing tunes! Check them out! ►► http://lazerhawk.bandcamp.com/
