  Welcome to this Wisecrack Edition on The Dark Knight Rises: What Went Wrong? Coming
  off the crest of the acclaim of The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises had a lot
  to live up to. In good Nolan fashion, not only did the film continue the ambitious
  themes established by its predecessor, but it added so much more. And that''s where
  things started to get messy. From the inspiration of Charles Dickens''s A Tale of
  Two Cities to Occupy Wall Street, we delve in to the themes behind the conclusion
  of one of the biggest trilogies of the decade. ==Get the Movie!== Digital Download
