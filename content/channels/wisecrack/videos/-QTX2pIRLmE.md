  JK Rowling has been regularly updating the Harry Potter lore; not through more books,
  not through movies, but through twitter. Fans voraciously consume extra-textual
  canon on works like Harry Potter, Star Wars and much more. But does this desire
  for an all-encompassing knowledge of how fictional worlds tell us something about
  our own anxieties? In this Wisecrack Edition, we’ll dive in to the works of philosopher
  Martin Heidegger to discover why people are so consumed by the desire to understand
  the nitty gritty details of fictional worlds, and to how it reflects an essential
  element of our humanity. === Watch More Episodes! === IDIOCRACY: Deep or Dumb? ►
