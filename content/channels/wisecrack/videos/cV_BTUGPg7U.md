  “With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility”- Uncle Ben’s famous lines have defined
  the inner struggle of everyone’s favorite web slinger across all of its 17,000 reboots.
  In this Wisecrack Edition, we explore how this mantra uniquely positions Spiderman
  as a reflection of American international relations. Just as America struggles with
  how it should responsibly wield its immense power and resources, so too does Peter
  struggle with how to responsibly use his powers as Spiderman. By drawing upon thinkers
  William V Spanos, Sacvan Bercovich and other International Relations theorists,
  we’ll uncover the philosophies that make Spiderman the quintessential American Superhero,
  and make some predictions as to how these philosophies will carry over in to Spiderman:
