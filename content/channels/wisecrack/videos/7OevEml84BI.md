  Winning South Park episode "Margaritaiville." We''ll explore how, through clever
  religious allegory, South Park crafts a multi-layered critique on the nature of
  power structures in our contemporary economic climate. By playfully positing that
  economics functions as a cryptic religion in its own right, South Park brilliantly
  satirize the financial crisis of 2008 – and the way people responded. NOTE: LegalZoom
