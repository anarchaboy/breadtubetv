  superhero movies to come out in the past decade. That’s largely because it’s not
  a superhero movie at all, it’s a Western. What makes Logan a masterpiece is how
  it takes some of the defining themes of the western genre – searching, enclosure,
  and the end of an era – and updates it to not only reflect the final moments of
  one of the most beloved comic book characters of all time, but to make a rather
  sly statement on the current state of the film industry. Welcome to this Wisecrack
