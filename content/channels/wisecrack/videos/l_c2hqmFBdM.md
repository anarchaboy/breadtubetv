  ►► http://wscrk.com/PtrnWC Rick and Morty is incredibly unique, with its remarkable
  characters, unforgettable episodes, and surprisingly profound subjects. But the
  show is also exceptional in its ability to play with our expectations while employing
  rather traditional storytelling techniques. In this special Wisecrack Edition, we
  explore how Dan Harmon’s Universal Theory of Storytelling (effectively a variation
  of Joseph Campbell’s Monomyth / Hero’s Journey) helps bring the show’s dark and
  subversive themes to life. By following one of our favorite episodes – “The Ricks
  Must Be Crazy” – we dive into the structure and formula for crafting great stories.
