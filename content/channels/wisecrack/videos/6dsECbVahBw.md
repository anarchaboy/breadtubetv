  Welcome to this special Wisecrack Edition on the Philosophy of Shia LaBeouf, exploring
  the motivations behind one of the most enigmatic actors and internet sensations
  around. After bouncing from one tabloid scandal to another, Shia LaBeouf emerged
  as an auteur of the bizarre with his #IAMSORRY installation – a performance art
  piece aimed at apologizing to the world with sincerity. Drawing from pop culture
  references like Deadpool, Spring Breakers and Brittney Spears, we dive headfirst
  into understanding how sincerity and apology works in a world of post-modern cynicism
  and disillusionment. ===More Episodes!=== DEADPOOL & Postmodernism ► http://wscrk.com/DeadpoolWE
