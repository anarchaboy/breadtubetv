  In preparation for Season 20 (!!!) of SOUTH PARK, we created this special Wisecrack
  Edition exploring the show''s philosophy of RELIGION over the past 19 years. Whether
  it be Jesus or Satan, Frosty the Snowman or God himself, Trey Parker and Matt Stone
  (who also created The Book of Mormon) aren''t afraid of addressing religion head-on
  – even if it isn''t exactly clear where the show stands on the issue. South Park
  forces us to take a hard look at what religion really means to us, and in the process,
  the show raises some important questions that other series wouldn’t have the nerve
  to ask. ===More Episodes!=== Philosophy of SOUTH PARK ► http://wscrk.com/SthPrkWE
