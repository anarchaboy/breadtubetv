  Welcome to this special Wisecrack Edition on Kanye West''s Philosophy of Death.
  Mortality is clearly a recurring theme in Kanye''s lyrics, videos and interviews.
  But is it any wonder that the WAY in which Kanye deals with death is similar to
  the ideas proposed by Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard? Is this similarity a
  total coincidence or is there truly a comparison to be made between Kanye and Kierkegaard?
