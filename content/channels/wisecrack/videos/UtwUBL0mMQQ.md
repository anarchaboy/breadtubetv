  a sequel, try not to take 13 years to make it. If you take 13 years anyway, then
  at least don’t rewrite the whole thing at the last minute, right? Wrong. In this
  edition of What Went Wrong, we explore how late stage rewrites in Pixar’s Finding
  Dory led to some questionable narrative choices ,resulting in a rather underwhelming
  film. === Get the Show! === DVD/Blu-ray ► http://amzn.to/2vY63uG Digital Download
