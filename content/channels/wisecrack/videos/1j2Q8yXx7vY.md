  on the Philosophy of Westworld, exploring how the show draws on one of humanity''s
  oldest stories to explore how free will shapes our understanding of good and evil.
  Through the lens of the show''s incredible cast of characters (Ford, William, The
  Man in Black, Arnold, Dolores, Bernard, and Maeve), we dive into themes of predestination,
  ethics, consciousness, and more, reflecting on how Westworld makes us think about
  the choices we make and how we live our own lives. ==Watch the Show!== Season 1
