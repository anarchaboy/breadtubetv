  The Stanley Parable and its successor, The Beginner’s Guide, are widely known as
  thought-provoking games. In this Wisecrack Edition, we’ll study the philosophical
  implications of the games as they relate to the relation between gamer and game
  (Stanley Parable), and between creator and game (Beginner’s Guide). Don''t forget
