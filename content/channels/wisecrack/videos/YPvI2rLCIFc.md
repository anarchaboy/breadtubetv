  In preparation for Suicide Squad, we created this special Wisecrack Edition diving
  into the philosophy of THE JOKER. We highlight some of the most lasting incarnations
  of the Clown Prince of Crime, including Alan Moore''s origin story in The Killing
  Joke, Christopher Nolan''s interpretation in The Dark Knight (starring Heath Ledger,
  RIP), and portrayals by Jack Nicholson (1989) and Cesar Romero (1966). The episode
  explores similarities and connections between The Joker and his rival-slash-muse,
  Batman. Want More COMIC Content? DEADPOOL ► http://wscrk.com/DeadPWE DAREDEVIL ►
