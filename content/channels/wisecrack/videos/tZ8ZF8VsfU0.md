  ►► http://wscrk.com/BjckHrsWE Welcome to this Wisecrack Edition on It’s Always Sunny
  in Philadelphia. If traditional sitcoms are defined by progressive character development,
  saccharine moralism, and sentimental romance, then It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia
  is unique in how it lampoons each of these tropes and presents us with an ensemble
  that deliberately avoids any sign of growth. Drawing from pioneering sitcoms like
  Cheers, Friends, and How I met your Mother, we’ll explore how Always Sunny isn’t
  just an anti-sitcom, it’s the perfect anti-sitcom. === More Episodes! === Philosophy
