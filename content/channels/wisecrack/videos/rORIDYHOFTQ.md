  Edition on The Philosophy of BoJack Horseman, exploring the dark existential undertones
  of this seemingly light-hearted cartoon. Behind the colorful animations and snarky
  one-liners is a show that''s astonishingly deep – a series that ponders important
  philosophical questions about living life in a meaningless universe. From Pascal
  to Sartre, we''ll dive into the thinkers and philosophies that are foundational
  to the show''s underlying message. === More TV Philosophy === Philosophy of RICK
