  Baby, Its Dumb Outside: How Everything Became Problematic - An Antidote
  to Jordan Peterson ** For those of you anxious to tell me how the word "dumb"
  is ableist, just don't. You're wrong. Literally no one uses it that way. The dictionary
  has multiple definitions for the word - guess which one comes dead last due to the
  fact no one uses it that way anymore? And now guess how far up the list the one
  I'm using is? I'm glad we had this talk.
