type: video
description: 'CORRECTION: @5:30 I said Andy posted an article containing the video
  of a guy kicking in the car windshield. In fact, the article does not contain that
  video. The article is about car vandalism by Leftist protesters in 2016, and Andy
  put the video with the article in order to imply that the folks in that video, even
  though there''s no evidence of this, are probably also Leftists. Willamette Week''s
