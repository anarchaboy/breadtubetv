description: 'This is a video that exists to tell you, in great and exhaustively subjective
  detail, why you should watch an anime called Symphogear. Seems like a familiar concept.
  I must be stealing someone’s idea. Please send me money through my Ko-fi or per-video
  Patreon, if you would like me to spend more time making this kind of elaborate nonsense:
  https://www.patreon.com/joycestick https://ko-fi.com/joycestick Or follow me on
  Twitter, where I often post updates and way too opinionated rambles and weird things:
  https://twitter.com/joy_ce_stick Send me some curiouscat asks, so eventually I’ll
  get sick of them and follow in Shaun’s footsteps by turning this into a dead link:
  https://curiouscat.me/joyce-stick I’m planning a video comparing and contrasting
  the Monogatari series with the Marvel Cinematic Universe (I have a logic there I
  swear), and other stuff, that’s going to be about the scope of this one here times
  a LOT… I’m really excited to make that video, I think I have a lot of really good
  ideas that I’m excited to explore for it, but it’s going to take a lot of time and
  effort as far as preparing, writing, and editing goes. If you want that, in particular,
  to exist faster, please especially send me money. (I''ll probably do other smaller
  projects in the meantime to keep the channel afloat.) Other videos! From me: Carole
