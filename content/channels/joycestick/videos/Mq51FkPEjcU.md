description: 'The latest anime from the creator of Cowboy Bebop and Space Dandy has
  a great premise, good music (your mileage may vary) and pointed social commentary
  about our increasingly techified world. I talk about that last bit for 15-odd minutes,
  and also hate on La La Land on the side. 05/16/2019: Title changed to something
  catchier at the suggestion of a commenter. Formerly called "Carole & Tuesday & the
  Perils of Curation by Automation" 05/18/2019: Made an error regarding the context
  of the use of the flip phone in Infinity War (although in fairness, this was a case
  of me forgetting the context of a previous movie in the MCU, which I''d say is reasonable
  seeing as we''ve had a decade of them and I''ve only seen most of them once). Acknowledgement
