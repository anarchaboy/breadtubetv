type: video
description: 'Last week, the BBC broadcast the 2017 Almeida Theatre production of
  Hamlet on BBC Two. Directed by Robert Icke and with Andrew Scott in the title role,
  this production of perhaps Shakespeare''s most famous play does more than simply
  apply a filter to the text but, instead, carries out some deep interventions into
  the narrative of Hamlet. In this video, I wanted to use this particular production
  to explore the director''s role in staging Shakespeare for a modern audience. There
  is no rule that says that Shakespeare plays should be relevant forever, however,
  this production does more than simply updating Shakespeare but fundamentally alters
  how its narrative works. I would suggest going to catch Hamlet first on BBC iPlayer
  before watching this video. It can be found below. Also, I don''t get much of a
  chance to do an overview of the script so, if you''re looking for a Hamlet summary,
  I''ve also provided a link to the Cliff''s Notes website. Hamlet (BBC iPlayer):

  If you''ve enjoyed this video and would like to see more including my What The Theory?
  series in which I provide some snappy introductions to key theories in the humanities
  as well as PhD vlogs in which I talk about some of the challenges of being a PhD
  student then do consider subscribing. Thanks for watching! Twitter: @Tom_Nicholas
