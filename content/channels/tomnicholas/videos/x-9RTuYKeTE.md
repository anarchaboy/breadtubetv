description: 'In this video, I look at how to write an abstract for a research paper
  with examples drawn from my own experience as a PhD Student. Writing an abstract
  can be tough, knowing what to include in an abstract and what to leave out when
  trying to summarise your conference paper or journal article in such a short amount
  of space can be particularly frustrating as these few hundred words will be what
  represents your work to conference organisers or potential readers. Here, then,
  I explain my own process for writing an abstract including ensuring it contains
  your motivation, problem statement, approach, results and conclusion. I then put
  these ideas into practice by creating an abstract for a recent video essay I released:
