title: 'Colonialism: WTF? Introduction to colonialism and imperialism'
date: "2019-10-11T16:09:09+08:00"
type: video
description: 'In this month''s episode of What the Theory?, we take a look at colonialism
  and imperialism. More specifically we look at the politics of colonialism and the
  appearance of colonialist ideology in culture. As a primer for my upcoming video
  on postcolonialism, we here take a potted look at the process of colonisation (or
  colonization for our American friends) before examining the historical justifications
  for both colonialism and empire. I then give an outline of how this ideology manifested
  itself within education under direct rule in India. Next time, we''ll draw upon
  some of these observations in order to look at the legacy of European colonialism
  in the present day and at how postcolonial authors, filmmakers, artists and theorists
  have engaged with this context. Further Reading Empire: A Very Short Introduction
