description: My thoughts on Jack Thorne's latest play Junkyard. Produced by Headlong
  at Bristol Old Vic and touring the the Rose Theatre Kingston and Theatr Clwyd. This
  is one in a series of performance analyses/reviews that I'm producing while undertaking
  my PhD at the University of Exeter. If you've enjoyed this video then please do
  check out the rest of my channel. I generally put out new videos every Tuesday and
  Friday discussing theatre and playwriting from the perspective of an aspirant and
  (some might say) emerging playwright, theatre maker and academic.
