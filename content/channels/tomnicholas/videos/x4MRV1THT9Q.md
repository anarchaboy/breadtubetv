type: video
description: 'Although originating in the dramatic theatre or narrative theatre, dramaturgy
  is an increasingly useful notion for describing the affective journey an audience
  goes on while watching a play or performance. In episode four of What the Theory?
  I take a look at the meaning and definition of dramaturgy. Developed by Gotthold
  Ephraim Lessing and Bertolt Brecht, the dramaturgical approach and role of the dramaturg
  in theatre originated in Germany but has come to be used in American theatre and
  British theatre too as well as elsewhere around the world. A few books for those
  interested in some extra reading... Dramaturgy and Performance by Cathy Turner and
  Synne Behrndt: https://he.palgrave.com/page/detail/Dramaturgy-and-Performance/?K=9781137561831

  I put out a whole range of videos discussing theatre and playwriting from the perspective
  of an aspirant and (some might say) emerging playwright and theatre maker as well
  as reflecting on my experience as a PhD Student. Twitter: @Tom_Nicholas Website:
