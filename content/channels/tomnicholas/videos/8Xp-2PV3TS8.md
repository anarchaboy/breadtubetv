description: Welcome to the fifth of my PhD vlogs. Follow my week as a PhD Student
  in Theatre and Drama at the University of Exeter. Thesis writing, research meetings
  and field work. As well as a couple of theatre workshops and rehearsals. I've been
  really inspired by some of the other PhD students vlogging their experiences as
  grad students at uni or college here on YouTube (particularly SimonOxfPhys who just
  so happens to be at the same institution myself and Emma Cole) and thought I'd give
  it a go to see quite how hard it was to keep up a weekly vlog (spoiler alert, fairly
  time-consuming). If you've enjoyed this video then please do check out the rest
  of my channel. I generally put out new videos every Tuesday and Friday discussing
  theatre and playwriting from the perspective of an aspirant and (some might say)
  emerging playwright, theatre maker and academic.
