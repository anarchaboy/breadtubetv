description: 'I recently caught the first production at the Bridge Theatre, Young
  Marx by Richard Bean and Clive Coleman. Nicholas Hytner''s new theatre venture kicks
  off with this new production starring Rory Kinnear in the role of Karl Marx. The
  production follows a 32 year old Marx as he hides from spies in a two bedroom flat
  in Soho''s Dean Street. I this short video essay, which is something between a performance
  analysis and a review, I bring together some reflections and thoughts on the show.

  a whole range of videos discussing theatre and playwriting from the perspective
  of an aspirant and (some might say) emerging playwright and theatre maker as well
  as reflecting on my experience as a PhD Student. Twitter: @Tom_Nicholas Website:
