description: Writing the first draft of a play can be an uphill struggle. Here's some
  tips I've picked up along the way... My name's Tom and I'm a playwright. As part
  of writing my new play, Happiness Ltd, I'm documenting my process through a series
  of ten short videos. In this video I talk about the triumphs and challenges of writing
  a first draft of a play including how I use this as an opportunity to develop characters
  and their voices. Follow along as I take you through my playwriting process from
  initial ideas through to final draft! Find out more at www.tomnicholas.com Supported
