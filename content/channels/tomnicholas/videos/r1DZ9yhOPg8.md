description: Research is vital when playwrighting in fleshing out your play, your
  characters and your story. My name's Tom and I'm a playwright. As part of writing
  my new play, Happiness Ltd, I'm documenting my process through a series of ten short
  videos. In this video I explain my ongoing research process for Happiness Ltd including
  playing a bunch of video games, reading books and making my very own game. Follow
  along as I take you through my playwriting process from initial ideas through to
  final draft! Find out more at www.tomnicholas.com Supported by Arts Council England.
