description: 'The Wardrobe Ensemble''s new show Education Education Education is currently
  touring after a successful run at the Edinburgh Fringe. I caught it at Exeter''s
  Northcott Theatre and, as I am want to do, have put together some thoughts in the
  form of a brief performance analysis. The play asks really interesting questions
  about the education system in the UK both in the 1990s and today as well as deconstructing
  the years of Cool Britannia and national identity more generally. Information about
  Education Education Education on tour can be found here: https://www.thewardrobeensemble.com/copy-of-the-time-seekers
  And the Wardrobe Ensemble can be found on Twitter here: https://twitter.com/WardrobEnsemble
  If you''ve enjoyed this video then please do check out the rest of my channel where
  I put out a whole range of videos discussing theatre and playwriting from the perspective
  of an aspirant and (some might say) emerging playwright and theatre maker as well
  as reflecting on my experience as a PhD Student. Twitter: @Tom_Nicholas Website:
