description: 'Neoliberalism (or neoliberal capitalism) is a term which gets thrown
  around a lot in cultural and political discourse. Is it often used to describe the
  policies of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s and the subsequent
  premierships of Bill Clinton and Tony Blair and the adjective "neoliberal" continues
  to be used as a derogatory phrase in the ongoing Democratic debates in the US. Yet
  it is also used with reference to the "gig economy" and services such as Uber, Deliveroo
  and Airbnb. Is neoliberalism, then, simply a synonym for capitalism or is there
  more to it than that? In this "neoliberalism explained" video, I aim to answer just
  that. In this month''s episode of What the Theory, I unpack what we mean when we
  talk about neoliberalism. From the early work of economists such as Milton Friedman
  (author of Capitalism and Freedom), Friedrich von Hayek (author of The Road to Serfdom)
  and the Mont Pelerin Society, through its implementation by Reagan and Thatcher
  to its infliction upon countries in the global south as described in The Shock Doctrine
  by Naomi Klein, I undertake a brief history of free-market capitalism and consider
  some of its consequences. Support me on Patreon at http://patreon.com/tomnicholas
