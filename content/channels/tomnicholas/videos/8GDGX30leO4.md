  | PhD Vlog #10'

description: In this week's PhD Vlog, I head to Stratford-upon-Avon to visit the Royal
  Shakespeare Company's Swan Theatre and unwittingly end up celebrating William Shakespeare's
  birthday. Despite the initial confusion, this did help me to rethink some of the
  reading I had been doing over the past week on place branding and place marketing.
  If you've enjoyed this video then please do check out the rest of my channel. I
  generally put out new videos every Tuesday and Friday discussing theatre and playwriting
  from the perspective of an aspirant and (some might say) emerging playwright, theatre
  maker and academic. Thanks for watching!
