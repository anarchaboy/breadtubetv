title: 'Literary Texts: WTF? Introduction to Cultural Texts and Roland Barthes'' From
  Work to Text'

description: 'Roland Barthes'' From Work to Text is a seminal essay which lays out
  why, in the humanities, we have come to refer to pieces of literature, films and
  many other things using the catch-all term "text". Because, we refer a lot to reading
  a text or interpreting a text. But what do we mean when talk about a literary text?
  The use of the term text in English Literature and literary studies might seem fairly
  straight-forward, but, across the wider humanities, we also often hear references
  to artistic texts, filmic texts and performance texts. On the face of it, these
  things may not seem like texts at all. So, what do we mean when we use the term
  text in film studies, for example, and how is that similar or different to our use
  of the term text in literary studies? Starting from Roland Barthes'' From Work to
  Text, in which he first employed the concept of the text to provide a new method
  for the analysis of literary texts, I seek to explore how the term has become used
  as a starting point for analysing culture more broadly. Anyone interested in having
  a look at From Work to Text by Roland Barthes can find it here: http://www.d.umn.edu/~cstroupe/handouts/8500/barthes_work_to_text.pdf
  In researching this video, I also found Peter Childs'' book Texts extremely useful
  which, if you have institutional access to JStor, can be found here: http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r1zbd
  Finally, the full text of Literary Studies: An Introduction can be found on the

  I put out a whole range of videos discussing theatre and playwriting from the perspective
  of an aspirant and (some might say) emerging playwright and theatre maker as well
