description: 'Roland Barthes’ The Death of the Author is a seminal text in the development
  of literary theory. Often considered the moment when structuralism gave way to poststructuralism
  as the dominant approach to cultural analysis, in The Death of the Author, Roland
  Barthes argues not only that we should not place too much emphasis on authorial
  intent when analysing a cultural text but also that the popular conception of the
  act of authorship might be altogether wrong. In this episode of What The Theory?,
  I aim to provide a Death of the Author summary and analysis both drawing out key
  ideas from Barthes’ essay and considering what the ramifications might be for how
  we analyse or read a text. Further Reading Image Music Text by Roland Barthes (includes
