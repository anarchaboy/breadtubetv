date: "2019-10-11T16:08:57+08:00"
type: video
description: 'In this latest episode of What The Theory?, I hope to provide an introduction
  to Marxism, culture and Marxist Literary Criticism and Theory. We''re going to begin
  with the economic theories of Marx and Engels, particularly their base and superstructure
  approach to analysing societal structures. We''ll then continue by looking at how
  these have informed a Marxist approach to literary theory but also how we can transpose
  these ideas into a wider Marxist cultural theory. Having looked heavily at some
  precise, fundamental ideas such as Semiotics and Phenomenology as well as some very
  large concepts such as Modernism and Postmodernism in recent videos, this is the
  first video in a number of What the Theory videos in which I''m keen to look in
  between these at approaches to culture, criticism and theory which are far more
  tangible and useable for the analysis of cultural texts. Further Reading Marxism
