title: Explaining My PhD Research | PhD Vlog

type: video
description: 'In this video, I wanted to give a brief, three minute thesis style introduction
  to my PhD research. I didn’t quite manage that brevity, however, I hope this goes
  some way to explaining my PhD for those of you who have asked in the comments to
  my other videos! For regular viewers, I hope this provides a little more context
  to some of my other PhD vlogs and gives you a little insight into what I actually
  get up to in my day to day life as a PhD Student at the University of Exeter. Particularly
  for those of you thinking of applying for a PhD yourself, I know when I was choosing
  a PhD thesis topic, it was really useful to have examples of PhD research others
  were engaged in to guide me. If you''re already studying, then communicating research
  to public or non-academic audiences is one of the vital skills for PhD students
  as it allows you to improve your research impact and helps you learn to articulate
  the value of your research to non-specialist audiences. It’s not something I’m excellent
  at yet but certainly something that creating these YouTube videos has helped me
  to improve upon! It’s also been a lot of fun to try a slightly different format
  for this video so do let me know what you think down in the comments! Useful Links
