description: 'I''ve been preparing for PhD upgrade process recently as well as having
  my new play performed in Exeter which is why I''ve been a little slow at uploading
  stuff. I am alive, however, and so thought I''d record another short PhD Student
  Vlog as these are some of my most-requested videos (even though I find them super-cringe
  to make). More reflections on shows I''ve seen and What the Theory? videos will
  be coming shortly I promise! If you''ve enjoyed this video then please do check
  out the rest of my channel where I put out a whole range of videos discussing theatre
  and playwriting from the perspective of an aspirant and (some might say) emerging
  playwright and theatre maker as well as reflecting on my experience as a PhD Student.
