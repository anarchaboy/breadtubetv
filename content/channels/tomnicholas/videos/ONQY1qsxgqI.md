description: When writing a play, a development week can be a brilliant way to explore
  your characters and story. Here's how mine went... My name's Tom and I'm a playwright.
  As part of writing my new play, Happiness Ltd, I'm documenting my process through
  a series of ten short videos. In this video, I report back on a week spent with
  four incredible actors and director David Prescott getting Happiness Ltd off the
  page and seeing what works in the hands of actors. Follow along as I take you through
  my playwriting process from initial ideas through to final draft! Find out more
