type: video
description: 'Complicité and Simon McBurney''s The Encounter, a play which uses binaural
  technology to tell a story of one man''s journey into the Amazon, will be available
  to stream for a limited amount of time here on YouTube shortly and, as such, I thought
  I''d do a performance analysis of the production which I was lucky enough to watch
  live as part of the Edinburgh International Festival in 2014. If you''ve enjoyed
  this video then please do check out the rest of my channel. I generally put out
  new videos every Tuesday and Friday discussing theatre and playwriting from the
  perspective of an aspirant and (some might say) emerging playwright, theatre maker
  and academic. Twitter: @Tom_Nicholas Website: www.tomnicholas.com Thanks for watching!'
