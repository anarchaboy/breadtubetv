title: 'How Plays Work: Blasted by Sarah Kane'

type: video
description: 'In Blasted, 4.48 Psychosis and Cleansed, Sarah Kane uses extreme imagery
  within her stage plays. In analysing the deep meaning of her work, however, there
  is far more subtlety in both theme and her use of Derrida''s concept of deconstruction.
  In this video, I analyse Kane''s debut play Blasted to see what it might teach us
  in how to write strong themes and cutting imagery into scripts. If you''ve enjoyed
  this video then please do check out the rest of my channel. I generally put out
  new videos every Tuesday and Friday discussing theatre and playwriting from the
  perspective of an aspirant and (some might say) emerging playwright, theatre maker
  and academic. Twitter: @Tom_Nicholas Website: www.tomnicholas.com Thanks for watching!'
