type: video
description: 'Black Mirror Season 5 was released just a couple of weeks ago and Striking
  Vipers, starring Anthony Mackie, kicks things off with style (and the following
  episodes, Smithereens and Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too, weren''t too bad either).
  Having made a couple of Black Mirror analysis videos in the past, I thought I''d
  put some of the concepts surrounding queer theory, sexuality, gender and masculinity
  that we''ve begun to take a look at in my What the Theory? series into practice
  in unpacking this new episode and exploring the politics of new Black Mirror. There
  are a bunch of "Black Mirror Striking Vipers Ending Explained" type videos out there
  already but, in this video essay, I take a slightly more theoretically-informed
  look at how the episode engages with ideas surrounding masculinity, gender and sexuality.
