type: video
description: My name's Tom and I'm a playwright. As part of writing my new play, Happiness
  Ltd, I'll be documenting my process through a series of ten short videos. Follow
  along as I take you through my playwriting process from initial ideas through to
  final draft! Hopefully this series will allow you to pick up some playwriting tips
  (a kind of playwriting 101 if you will) and teach you to make your plays or other
  writing for the stage into compelling drama. Find out more at www.tomnicholas.com
