type: video
description: 'I recently saw Marianne Elliott''s production of Angels in America by
  Tony Kushner as part of the NTLive broadcast from the National Theatre. Both Part
  One: Millenium Approaches and Part Two: Perestroika totally captivated me and, as
  such, I wanted to do a video essay reflecting on it. Particularly here, I look to
  explore how we can read Angels in America as a piece of Epic Theatre, the term used
  by Brecht and Piscator to conceive of a new form of political theatre. My hope is
  that, if you are a playwright or other form of writer you might be able to go away
  with some new tools but, equally, if you are an audience member, that you might
  be able to develop a deeper understanding of Tony Kushner''s Angels in America as
  a play. If you''ve enjoyed this video then please do check out the rest of my channel.
  I generally put out new videos every Tuesday and Friday discussing theatre and playwriting
  from the perspective of an aspirant and (some might say) emerging playwright, theatre
  maker and academic. Twitter: @Tom_Nicholas Website: www.tomnicholas.com Thanks for
  watching!'
