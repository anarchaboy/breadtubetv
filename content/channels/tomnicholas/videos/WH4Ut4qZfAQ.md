description: Planning your story can help you start writing your play with confidence
  and direction. Here's how I plan mine... My name's Tom and I'm a playwright. As
  part of writing my new play, Happiness Ltd, I'll be documenting my process through
  a series of ten short videos. In this video I explain the Index Card system that
  I use for planning the narrative of my plays and how that influenced structure and
  scene construction in Happiness Ltd. Follow along as I take you through my playwriting
  process from initial ideas through to final draft! Find out more at www.tomnicholas.com
