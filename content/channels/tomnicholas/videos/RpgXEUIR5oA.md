type: video
description: 'A brief introduction to postdramatic and postmodern theatre as first
  theorised by Hans Theis Lehmann. The first in a series in which I briefly (and,
  hopefully, accessibly) introduce some core academic concepts and ideas. In this
  first episode, I explain the scholarship of Han-Thies Lehmann as well as the theatre
  of Martin Crimp, Sarah Kane, Caryl Churchill, Forced Entertainment, Ontroerend Goed
  and GETINTHEBACKOFTHEVAN. If you''ve enjoyed this video then please do check out
  the rest of my channel. I generally put out new videos every Tuesday and Friday
  discussing theatre and playwriting from the perspective of an aspirant and (some
  might say) emerging playwright, theatre maker and academic. Twitter: @Tom_Nicholas
