type: video
description: 'Day Three! In which I struggle to understand de Certeau and his masterwork
  The Practice of Everyday Life, pop to the public library and go for a run! Follow
  a day in the life of a PhD Student as I begin my week of PhD vlogs. My aim is to
  record one video from Monday to Friday this week, releasing them two days later
  (Wednesday - Sunday) to give you a full insight into a week as a PhD student and
  a broader look at postgrad PhD student life in general. There''ll be lots of reading
  academic papers and academic journals as well as books, lots of note taking, PhD
  thesis writing and (hopefully) some fun stuff too! This is something that people
  have asked for a number of times in the comments of some of my other videos so I
  hope you enjoy! If you''ve enjoyed this video then please do check out the rest
  of my channel where I put out a whole range of videos discussing theatre and playwriting
  from the perspective of an aspirant and (some might say) emerging playwright and
  theatre maker as well as reflecting on my experience as a PhD Student. Twitter:
