  Explained'

description: 'Structuralism is a form of literary theory which, inspired by semiotics
  and the linguistics of Ferdinand de Saussure, emerged in France in the 1950s. In
  this week’s episode of What the Theory?, we take a look at how structuralism and
  structuralist theory enable us to identify the underlying structures which inform
  how literature, film, performance, visual art and all other forms of cultural text
  are created and read. If you’re look for semiotics and structuralism explained simply
  and engagingly then, hopefully, this might be the video you’re looking for! Also,
  if you’d like to get your hands on a copy of the script to this video with footnotes
  and references to pour over to your heart’s content then check out my Patreon at

  We begin by looking at genre as a form of structuralist analysis before taking a
  brief overview of Saussure’s notion of diachronic and synchronic linguistics and
  his suggestion that it is only possible to understand an individual use of language
  (which he calls parole) by understanding the wider linguistic system of which it
  is a part (something Saussure calls langue). We then take a look at how various
  literary theorists including Claude Levi-Strauss, Roland Barthes, Vladimir Propp
  and (very briefly) Michel Foucault have taken used structuralist linguistics as
  a basis for literary and cultural analysis. Distinguishing between “high structuralism”
  and “low structuralism”, we take a look at poetics and the pursuit of a consistent
  narrative structure of myth as well as looking at Roland Barthes’ notion of cultural
  codes and cultural myths as he outlines them in his 1957 book Mythologies. Further
