date: "2019-09-15T10:39:47+08:00"
description: 'In this introduction to Gramsci and his neomarxist theory of hegemony,
  in particular cultural hegemony, I explore this concept which has been hugely influential
  in contemporary social theory, political theory and cultural theory. Hopefully a
  good starting point for understanding Gramsci, this video essay is the third episode
  of my series What The Theory?, in which I explore key critical concepts and ideas
  in the humanities. If you''ve enjoyed this video and have a suggestion of what I
  might make an episode of What the Theory? about next then please do drop me a line
  in the comments! Further Reading Introducing Marxism: A Graphic Guide by Rupert
