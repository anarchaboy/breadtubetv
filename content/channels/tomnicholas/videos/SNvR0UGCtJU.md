description: 'In this latest episode of Essay Tips, I take a look at how to find citations
  and references for essays and assignments, particularly at undergraduate level.
  Looking back at my video on using Google Scholar, I thought it worth putting together
  a more entry-level video with help for bibliography preparation. While I give some
  tips for constructing a bigger bibliography to show essay markers that you''ve really
  got a mastery of understanding in the subject that you''re writing about, I also
  hope to get across why citations and references are useful for making your argument
  stronger and more convincing. Most universities will have great guidance available
  on how to incorporate citations into your essay writing. I have previously found
  this page from Leeds University on Harvard referencing useful: https://library.leeds.ac.uk/skills-citations-harvard#activate-how_to_incorporate_citations_into_your_work
  If writing a longer piece of work, I would suggest software such as EndNote or Mendeley
  (https://www.mendeley.com) which can automate the bibliography process for you.
  If you''ve enjoyed this video then please do check out the rest of my channel where
  I put out a whole range of videos discussing theatre and playwriting from the perspective
  of an aspirant and (some might say) emerging playwright and theatre maker as well
  as reflecting on my experience as a PhD Student. Twitter: @Tom_Nicholas Website:
