type: video
description: 'Fuelled by my impatience for the release of The Good Place Season 4,
  today’s episode of Politix takes a look at the moral philosophy of The Good Place
  (created by Michael Schur for NBC) in order to consider what the show might reveal
  about classism in contemporary society and our tendency to conflate morality and
  class. In this The Good Place analysis, we’ll particularly look at how, in The Good
  Place Season 1, Eleanor Shelstrop (Kristen Bell) and Jason Mendoza (Manny Jacinto)
  are often cast as working-class stereotypes who are not so much immoral as simply
  lacking in what Pierre Bourdieu refers to as cultural capital. If you’ve enjoyed
  this The Good Place Video Essay then please do check out the rest of my Politix
  series in which I’ve undertaken critical analysis of BoJack Horseman, Unbreakable
  Kimmy Schmidt and more. Further Reading The Forking Trolley: An Ethical Journey
