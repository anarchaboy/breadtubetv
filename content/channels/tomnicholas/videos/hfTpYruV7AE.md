description: 'The first pilot to my Essay Tips series! I share my method for reading
  and understanding a journal article or paper quickly and efficiently including how
  to take good, concise notes and remember useful citations. If your method differs
  from mine or you think you can give me some pointers then let me know in the comments!
  This is the first in a series of videos I''m hoping to produce while undertaking
  my PhD at the University of Exeter on tips for students at university or college
  whether undergraduate, postgraduate or otherwise. Note: The programme to the left
  (which I highlight in) is Mendeley. Apologies for forgetting to state this in the
  video!! If you''ve enjoyed this video then please do check out the rest of my channel.
  I generally put out new videos every Tuesday and Friday discussing theatre and playwriting
  from the perspective of an aspirant and (some might say) emerging playwright, theatre
  maker and academic. My tagging system was borrowed from this article on The Thesis
