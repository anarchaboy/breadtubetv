description: 'Catch-22 by Joseph Heller (recently the subject of a television adaptation
  with George Clooney in the role of the ruthlessly ambitious Colonel Cathcart for
  US streaming service Hulu) is one of the classic books of the twentieth century.
  In this Catch 22 summary and analysis video, I take you through a book report which
  outlines some of the background and context surrounding the book (and its author
  Joseph Heller) as well as discussing its style and (without spoilers) providing
  a brief plot summary. A biting satirical novel set in the Mediterranean theatre
  of the Second World War (yet more accurately approached as a response to the Korean
  War and Vietnam War), I moreover unpack the absurdist influences behind Catch 22
  such as the Czech author Franz Kafka whose novel The Trial bares numerous similarities
  with Heller''s novel. My initial plan had been to stick with slightly older works
  of literature for my How To Read It series and so I''d be interested to know what
  you think of me covering twentieth century novels such as Catch-22. A well as wanting
  to tie in with the Hulu series, however, I was keen to cover something slightly
  more accessible for Episode Two having looked at Ulysses in the last! If you''d
