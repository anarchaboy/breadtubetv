description: 'Arthur Miller uses the past and present to incredible dramatic effect
  in Death of a Salesman, All My Sons and many of his other plays. Think about how
  to use these skills in your own writing by learning from the master. In this series,
  I analyse and discuss the work of some of the world''s best playwrights, dramatists
  and theatre makers in order to see what we might learn from them in order to improve
  our own craft as writers. Further Reading All My Sons by Arthur Miller US: https://amzn.to/2EGmYrD
