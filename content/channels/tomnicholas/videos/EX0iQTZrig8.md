description: 'Staying motivated on long term projects can be hard. With the end goal
  far away, it can be tough to stay motivated with long projects that take upwards
  of a year. This is certainly something I''ve been finding with my PhD thesis writing.
  Recently, I''ve been finding myself in something of a motivational slump and so,
  here, I thought I''d collect some thoughts on how to stay motivated if you''re carrying
  out a similar project. As always, if you''ve got any motivation tips for PhD students
  (or people working in any field) that you''d like to share then do feel free to
  pop those in the comments as well as letting me know if there''s anything you''re
  currently struggling with in your working process. If you''ve enjoyed this video
  and would like to see more including my What The Theory? series in which I provide
  some snappy introductions to key theories in the humanities as well as PhD vlogs
  in which I talk about some of the challenges of being a PhD student then do consider
  subscribing. Thanks for watching! Twitter: @Tom_Nicholas Website: www.tomnicholas.com'
