description: 'Some tips for how to conduct interdisciplinary research at PhD, MA or
  undergraduate degree level. Including how to approach reading papers from a completely
  new research field, methodology or discipline. As an interdisciplinary researcher
  myself I have to read papers and articles from Theatre, Geography and Urban Studies
  fields. This has presented me with some unique challenges so here (hopefully) are
  some tips! If you''ve enjoyed this video then please do check out the rest of my
  channel. I generally put out new videos every Tuesday and Friday discussing theatre
  and playwriting from the perspective of an aspirant and (some might say) emerging
  playwright, theatre maker and academic. Twitter: @Tom_Nicholas Website: www.tomnicholas.com
