description: 'As promised: a Q+A! I was gonna wait to put this out until reaching
  15,000 subs but, ever keen to keep to schedule, it''s going out a few days before.
  So let''s just pretend, okay? Packed with questions from subscribers and patrons
  on topics including defining an ideology or ideologies, some follow-up questions
  on my What the Theory? video on The Society of the Spectacle, opinions on Breadtube
  or Left Tube, Lefttube (whichever you prefer), updates on my PhD, writing a Research
  Proposal or Research Proposals, and some essay tips on choosing an essay topic.
  I hope it''s interesting and not too ramble-y. Thanks to everyone who sent in questions
  for me to answer and to everyone who''s signed up to support me on Patreon in the
  past couple of weeks. If you''d like to do the same then you can find my page at
  https://patreon.com/tomnicholas If you''ve enjoyed this video and would like to
  see more including my What The Theory? series in which I provide some snappy introductions
  to key theories in the humanities as well as PhD vlogs in which I talk about some
  of the challenges of being a PhD student then do consider subscribing. Thanks for
  watching!'
