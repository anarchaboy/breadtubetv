title: How Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt deconstructs the Millennial myth | Politix

type: video
description: 'For the first "proper" episode of my Politix series, we''re diving in
  to Tina Fey''s Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and Aziz Ansari''s Master of None in order
  to explore how each show represents Millennials, or the Millennial generation. This
  video essay asks what it is that differentiates Millennials from previous generations
  (particularly Baby Boomers and Generation X) and analyses how these differentiations
  play out in Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and Master of None. Particularly, we take
  a look at how the practices or behaviours of Millennials (such as a reliance upon
  technology and a tendency to have children or buy a house later) have been used
  as a marker for pointing out Millennials'' supposed flaws. Following this, we see
  how both shows problematicise these accusations. As I''ve said before, this video
  essay format is something of a new experiment for me so, if you have any thoughts,
  please do let me know in the comments. And, here''s some references to some of the
  books and studies I refer to throughout the video (not alphabetised I''m afraid...):
