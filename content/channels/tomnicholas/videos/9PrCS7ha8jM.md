title: 'How Plays Work: An Enemy of the People by Henrik Ibsen'

type: video
description: 'Ibsen''s A Doll''s House and An Enemy of the People both engage with
  politics in intelligent and mature ways, avoiding agitprop-style polemicism and
  overt persuasion. In this video, in order to uncover some playwriting tips for how
  to write plays of our own, I explore how Ibsen ensures his work remains radical
  and yet avoids becoming pure propaganda. If you''ve enjoyed this video then please
  do check out the rest of my channel. I generally put out new videos every Tuesday
  and Friday discussing theatre and playwriting from the perspective of an aspirant
  and (some might say) emerging playwright, theatre maker and academic. Twitter: @Tom_Nicholas
