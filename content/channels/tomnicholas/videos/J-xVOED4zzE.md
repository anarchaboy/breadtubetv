title: How BoJack Horseman Critiques the 1990s | Tom Nicholas

description: 'With BoJack Horseman Season Five being released on Netflix a week and
  a bit ago, I thought I’d add to the avalanche of BoJack Horseman analysis videos
  already on YouTube by tackling how the series critiques our relationship with the
  recent past. In particular, the role of Horsin’ Around (the "very famous TV show"
  in which BoJack once starred) in informing the protagonist of the show’s identity
  has always fascinated me. And so I thought I’d explore how BoJack Horseman subverts
  and critiques our memory of what culture really was like "back in the 90''s". I''m
  particularly interested in the narrative of Bojack, Mr. Peanutbutter and Sarah Lynn''s
  own trajectory between the 90''s and today as well as the career struggles of Todd
  and Diane in the present. Mostly, however, I''m interested in what all of these,
  taken together, might tell us about 90''s culture and that of today. As is perhaps
  clear in the video, I was particularly inspired by Lindsay Ellis'' video on Stranger
  Things, It and the Upside Down of Nostalgia from December of last year. However,
  here, I primarily draw on the work of Frederic Jameson on parody and pastiche. So,
  I hope this video essay adds something new to the videos already existing which
  interogate the philosophy of BoJack Horseman and other angles of analysis while
  also adding to my own Politix series. Further Reading BoJack Horseman: The Art Before
