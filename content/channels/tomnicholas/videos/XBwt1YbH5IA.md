description: 'I''ve recently been putting the ideas from Deep Work by Cal Newport
  into practice in order to get a better PhD work life balance. Having just moved
  house, things have been a little hectic and, thus, productivity has taken a bit
  of a hit. Having drawn on Cal Newport''s ideas to combat this dip in productivity,
  I wanted to reflect on my Deep Work experience. By adopting the notion of undertaking
  "deep work sessions" rather than splitting my writing time up throughout the day,
  I''ve been able to use my time far more productively and to a much more disciplined
  schedule than before. Furthermore, it''s also allowed me to have. much more mindful
  relationship with work and been a real boon to my mental health which we all know
  can take a battering during a PhD! Deep Work is available from Better World Books
