description: Inspired by David Mamet, I wrote myself 5 tips for redrafting my latest
  play... My name's Tom and I'm a playwright. As part of writing my new play, Happiness
  Ltd, I'm documenting my process through a series of ten short videos. In this video,
  I sum up what I learned from having a rehearsed reading of the play at The Bike
  Shed Theatre, Exeter. Follow along as I take you through my playwriting process
  from initial ideas through to final draft! Find out more at www.tomnicholas.com
