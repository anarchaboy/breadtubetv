description: My analysis of Bristol Old Vic's production of Pink Mist by Owen Sheers
  on its 2017 UK tour at Birmingham Rep (The Rep). If you've enjoyed this video then
  please do check out the rest of my channel. I generally put out new videos every
  Tuesday and Friday discussing theatre and playwriting from the perspective of an
  aspirant and (some might say) emerging playwright, theatre maker and academic. Thanks
  for watching!
