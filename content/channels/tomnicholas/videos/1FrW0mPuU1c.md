description: 'My thoughts on My Country; A Work in Progress by Carol Ann Duffy and
  Rufus Norris. The National Theatre''s "response" to the Brexit vote, this verbatim
  piece premiered in the Dorfman auditorium in March 2017 before touring the UK. This
  is the latest in a series of performance anaylses/reviews I''ve been undertaking
  as part of my PhD Research at the University of Exeter. If you''ve enjoyed this
  video then please do check out the rest of my channel. I generally put out new videos
  every Tuesday and Friday discussing theatre and playwriting from the perspective
  of an aspirant and (some might say) emerging playwright, theatre maker and academic.
