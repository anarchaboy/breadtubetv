description: 'Beginning by David Eldridge will be receiving a West End transfer (to
  the Ambassadors Theatre) in the New Year. As such, I thought I''d collect together
  some of my thoughts on the production from when I saw it at the National Theatre
  in the form of a short Performance Analysis. News of Beginning''s transfer here:

  I put out a whole range of videos discussing theatre and playwriting from the perspective
  of an aspirant and (some might say) emerging playwright and theatre maker as well
