description: Having watched the entirety of the debate between both of them since
  this stream aired, I now fall on the side of Destiny. I still like them both and
  don't want them to split - and I definitely disagree with plenty of what Destiny
  did in the context of this drama - but in this regard specifically, I relate heavily
  with Destiny's frustration. Website - https://www.vaush.gg/ Twitter - https://twitter.com/VaushV
