description: I think I said it over the course of this video, but I'll say it again.
  I overprepared. To those curious, I am very comfortable with the rhetoric I employed
  against him. He's very clearly a bad faith actor who looks to take advantage of
  the civility of his opponents. When he realized he couldn't do that to me, he bailed.
  Also, hurrah for my first real debate with a conservative public figure! Twitter
