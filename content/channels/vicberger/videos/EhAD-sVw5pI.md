description: 'Now that Full House has gotten a reboot, it is time to give its distant
  cousin Step By Step its due. If there''s a Netflix audience for the Tanners, there
  HAS to be one for the Lambert and Fosters. Hulu? Amazon? Ham Radio? Come on, who
  WOULDN''T want to see a middle-aged Angela Watson slide into a ball pit or Sasha
  Mitchell use his karate skills inside a Turkish prison. We hope this reimagining
  is the spark that launches an online revolution to give that show you vaguely remember
  that came on before Family Matters its own pointless reboot. And I''m pretty sure
  all the cast members are alive, though I''ve been burned by Wikipedia before. New
  Title idea: "Step By Step...By Step" You''re welcome. By Matt Oswalt @MattOswaltVA
  and Vic Berger @VicBergerIV'
