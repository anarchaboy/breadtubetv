description: 'Before the 2016 election, Donald Trump dreamed of having his own talk
  show geared to followers of his Twitter account. He made this pilot, but instead
  picking up a talk show on NBC, he unfortunately became president of the United States
  of America. I am proud to present to you, for the first time ever, Donald Trump''s
  lost talk show pilot, "@realDonaldTrump: The Television Show." If you like my videos
