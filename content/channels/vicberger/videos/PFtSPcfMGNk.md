title: Ben Shapiro ABUSES Free Speech, CLAIMS No Responsibility For Mosque Shooting
date: "2019-10-11T16:15:27+08:00"
type: video
description: 'Ben Shapiro went on Laura Ingraham''s show to deny he had any influence
  on the Quebec City mosque shooter''s views on Muslims. The mosque shooter was a
  Ben Shapiro superfan, checking his twitter feed obsessively in the weeks leading
  up to the shooting, as well as checking other anti-Islam, far-right and/or conspiracy
  theorist twitter feeds, including Laura Ingraham, herself. The shooter''s radicalization
  from the anti-Muslim rhetoric of Ben Shapiro, Donald Trump and others, combined
  with mental instability as well as access to deadly weapons, culminated with the
  mosque shooting. If you like my videos and want to support my work, check out my
