description: 'As quickly as I became ecstatic when I saw that Gregg returned to On
  Cinema today, my anger set in after seeing Ayaka''s true colors. It appears that
  she is a liar and a film buff-destroyer. I dealt with my mixed emotions through
  the power of song. Hope this helps others dealing with these strong emotions due
  to the August 28, 2013 episode. *LYRICS: Gregg is back, Gregg is back Hi ho, Silver,
  Gregg is back Gregg is back, Gregg is back Hi ho, Silver, Gregg is back (...but
  I''m so mad about...) Ay yi yi, Ayaka Ay yi yi, Ayaka The show can go in only "one
  direction" but since Ayaka''s around the only direction is down She claims she''s
  a ''Tough Mudder'' but how can you trust her? because she lies, she lies, she lies
  yes, she lies you can see it in her eyes She thinks she''s cute in that little black
  suit but I bet her library card is filled up with fines Ay yi yi, Ayaka You''re
  driving a wedge through Tim and Gregg Ay yi yi, Ayaka (just ''getaway'', Ayaka...)'
