description: 'After seeing the finale of season three of On Cinema, I felt that Tim
  was a little uneasy when speaking about why his ladyfriend and guest, Ayaka, left
  the country, as well as the show. I think that he was afraid to admit the real reason
  for her departure, which may or may not have something to do with Gregg''s copy
  of Airheads. This is a song written as an audio-letter to Tim in hope of revealing
  the truth. I think this gets to the bottom of it. I woke up one morning with this
  song in my head and I went right to the piano. A similar occurrence of this happened
  to Paul McCartney when he wrote the song "Yesterday". *LYRICS: I bet you''re wondering
  what Ayaka''s doing tonight Is she watching Airheads with her friends or with her
  mom and dad? I hope when she laughs she thinks of you and the times you had Watching
  Adam Sandler, Fraser and Buscemi on the big screen I bet you''re wondering what
  Ayaka''s doing tonight Is she cuddled up in Japan with another man? Some might call
  her a thief but maybe that''s fair ''cause she stole your heart And the hardest
  part is thinking ''bout the films you saw together Most of the words she said You
  couldn''t comprehend (that''s what you claimed) And you blamed her leaving on immigration
  issues And you said she was a rebound after your marriage ended in divorce And you
  blamed it on cultural differences Or that she really wasn''t the right woman for
  you Maybe she could''a been a buff She could''a been a contender But I bet you really
  broke it off for a certain friendship Because that friendship ain''t a VHS that
  can be erased I think you really broke it off for your On Cinema friendship Between
  you and Gregg Oh, on cinema, on cinema, on cinema On friendship, friendship, friendship,
  cinema, friendship! Now I bet you know what Gregg is doing tonight (Credit to Oscar-winner
  Marlon Brando, the Oscar-snubbed cast of Airheads & Vin Diesel for their appearance
  in this video)'
