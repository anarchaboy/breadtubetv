description: My reaction to the news that Jeff Lynne was once again NOT nominated
  for the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame. Jeff Lynne is the man behind Electric Orchestra,
  The Move, The Idle Race, multiple Tom Petty, George Harrison & Bryan Adams records,
  Traveling Wilburys, etc. The list could go on and on.
