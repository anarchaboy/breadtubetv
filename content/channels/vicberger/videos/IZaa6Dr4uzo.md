description: '“You ready?!? Let’s go, Boys!” NEWLY-RELEASED video proves, beyond any
  doubt, that Gavin McInnes’s gang sought out violence on protesters at his murder
  cosplay event in NYC On October 12, 2018. I synced FOUR separate camera angles of
  the assaults. Watch til the end to see NYPD officers turn a blind eye to Proud Boy
  violence. Also, McInnes’s gang members are seen bragging about assaulting protesters.
