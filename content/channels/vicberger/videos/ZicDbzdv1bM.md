  The #WalkAway March was held October 27, 2018. The #WalkAway movement showcases
  stories of why Americans walk away from leftist ideology and the Democratic Party.
  The organizer, Brandon Straka, says he is pleased with an organized march last weekend
  in the nation’s capital and plans to take the idea on the road. “I thought it was
  spectacular. I am so proud of the entire weekend from beginning to end." If you
