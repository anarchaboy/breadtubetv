description: Peter Jackson (Director of The Hobbit 1,2&3) made this tribute for Gregg
  Turkington, who completed a world record of watching 501 movies in 501 days. The
  original record was supposed to be for 500 movies within 500 days, but due to unforeseen
  circumstances, Gregg had to take the world record to a higher level (501 movies
  within 501 days.) Congrats to Gregg!
