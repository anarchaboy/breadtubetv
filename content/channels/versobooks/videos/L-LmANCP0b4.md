type: video
description: In this video George Monbiot explains how Labour's election success was
  hugely driven by Bernie Sanders-style organising techniques, and how, going-forward,
  this must be combined with "a thrilling new political vision fit for the 21st century,
  that isnâ€™t defined to destroy the living planet and pull away the environmental
  rug from under us".
