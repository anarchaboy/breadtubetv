  in discussion. This panel addresses Anarchisms that exceed the container of normative
  descriptions of social upheaval, dissent, and social disorder. We draw from our
  individual and collective inquiry to include the riotous lives of Black girls in
  the early twentieth century, Anarcho-Indigenous feminisms in the Americas, Black
  utopic visions, and queer anarchy as ways to consider an archive of “Anarchisms
  Otherwise.” We explore permanent and impermanent sources of insurrection and radical
  potentiality. Recorded at Verso Books in Brooklyn on April 17, 2019. Co-sponsored
  with the Global South Center at Pratt Institute. ABOUT THE SPEAKERS Macarena Gómez-Barris
