description: 'A conversation wtih representatives of Addameer, Black Youth Project
  100, and RAPP (Release Aging People in Prison). At Verso Books in Brooklyn, November
  29, 2017. This panel explores the different ways criminalization fractures communities
  and separates people from the place(s) they call home. Bringing together activists
  from New York City to Palestine, it looks at how state violence enforces a system
  of racialized dispossession, whether through eviction, deportation, incarceration,
  or colonization and ethnic cleansing. We’ll also learn how people are protecting
  their communities by fighting back against the increasingly militarized policing
  of their neighborhoods, supporting prisoners’ rights, and advancing a vision of
  freedom and self-determination. About the speakers: DARIALIZA AVILA-CHEVALIER is
  an organizer with the NYC chapter of Black Youth Project 100, a member-based organization
  of radical 18-to-35-year-old people that work toward the liberation of Black people.
  BYP100 works to center the most marginalized, which includes incarcerated people
  and trans/gender non-conforming people. Their work is done via direct action, political
  education, and internal leadership development. Their current long-term project
  is Campaign H.O.M.E. (Housing Over Monitoring and Evictions), which seeks to end
  the racist NYCHA policy of Permanent Exclusion. Before joining BYP100, Darializa
  organized with Students for Justice in Palestine and helped launch the Columbia
  University Apartheid Divest campaign. MUJAHID FARID is the lead organizer for the
  Release Aging People in Prison Campaign (RAPP), which aims to decarcerate US prisons
  by accelerating the release rate of elderly people. Farid himself was confined for
  33 years in New York State and released in 2011, after entering the system in 1978
  with a sentence of 15 years to life. While confined, Farid earned four college degrees,
  including two Master’s, and was part of a trio that created the first HIV/AIDS peer
  education program in NYS prisons, which later developed into the widely acclaimed
  PACE (Prisoners AIDS Counseling & Education) program. In 2013 he was awarded an
  Open Society Soros Justice Fellowship, a joint NYS legislative commendation, and
  a Citizens Against Recidivism, Inc. award for social activism. In 2016 RAPP was
  awarded the New York Nonprofit Media’s Cause Award. SAHAR FRANCIS has been the director
  of Addameer (Arabic for conscience), a prisoner support and human rights advocacy
  organization, since 2005, and has been a human rights legal advocate since 1994.
  She specializes in issues of Palestinian political prisoners, including ill treatment
  and torture, administrative detention, prison conditions, and prisoners'' rights.
  She has extensive litigation experience in the Israeli military court system as
  well as in Israeli civil courts. Organized by Adalah-NY: Campaign for the Boycott
  of Israel, Addameer Prisoner Support & Human Rights Association, BYP100 NYC chapter,
