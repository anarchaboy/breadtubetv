description: 'Decolonising the English curriculum is about understanding and undoing
  mythologies. Priyamvada Gopal argues we need to challenge the idea that some cultures
  are the ‘givers’ and the ‘teachers’, and others are the ‘takers’ and the ‘taught’.
  We need access to other narratives. Insurgent Empire: Anticolonial Resistance and
  British Dissent is out now https://www.versobooks.com/books/2965-insurgent-empire
  Priyamvada Gopal is University Reader in Anglophone and Related Literatures in the
  Faculty of English at the University of Cambridge and Fellow Churchill College.
  She is the author of Literary Radicalism in India: Gender, Nation and the Transition
  to Independence and The Indian English Novel: Nation, History and Narration.'
