description: 'Sophie Lewis calls for a more radical response to abortion; recognising
  that it is a form of necessary violence. We need to move away from the focus on
  abortion as just a form of health-care, or arguments around when human life begins,
  and defend abortion as a right to stop doing gestational work. Full Surrogacy Now:
  Feminism Against Family by Sophie Lewis is out now https://www.versobooks.com/books/2951-full-surrogacy-now
