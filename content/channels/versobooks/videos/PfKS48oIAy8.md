description: 'Some of the fiercest resistance to empire came from outside of Britain.
  In 1865, Jamaican rebels challenged the limited ''freedom'' offered by capitalism,
  being emancipated from slavery only to go work on sugar plantations as waged labourers.
  Priyamvada Gopal shows how the British tradition of anti-colonialism was heavily
  influenced by resistance from within the colonies. Insurgent Empire: Anticolonial
  Resistance and British Dissent is out now https://www.versobooks.com/books/2965-insurgent-empire
  Priyamvada Gopal is University Reader in Anglophone and Related Literatures in the
  Faculty of English at the University of Cambridge and Fellow Churchill College.
  She is the author of Literary Radicalism in India: Gender, Nation and the Transition
  to Independence and The Indian English Novel: Nation, History and Narration.'
