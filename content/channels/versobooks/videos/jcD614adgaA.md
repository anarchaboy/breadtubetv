description: 'The modern-day Christopher Columbus is someone who is very excited by
  colonialism and vast amounts of money. Someone who exploits their workers and depends
  on that historical layering of exploitation that runs from badly paid wage workers
  to slavery. Someone who is celebrated as a hero around the world. Someone like Jeff
  Bezos and Elon Musk" - Raj Patel is the co-author of A History of the World in Seven
