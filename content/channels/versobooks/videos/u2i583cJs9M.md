description: 'Part 3 of the “ABCs of Socialism” series, sponsored by Verso Books and
  Jacobin, featuring lectures and discussions with contributors of the “ABCs of Socialism”
  book. Filmed at Verso Books in Brooklyn, March 20, 2017. Socialism is in the air.
  But the idea of socialism also faces heavy counterattack—and not only from the Right.
  Within the Left itself, there is suspicion of an ideal many view as single-mindedly
  focused on economic issues and distant from other everyday sufferings, especially
  those of black and brown people. The underlying assumption is that socialism, a
  supposedly Western (and white) ideology, while capable of addressing economic injustices,
  remains incapable of speaking to the lived experience of oppression and discrimination
  in the Global South, as well as oppressed groups elsewhere. Is there any validity
  in this criticism? About the speaker: Nivedita Majumdar is an associate professor
  of English at John Jay College. She is the secretary of the Professional Staff Congress,
  the CUNY faculty and staff union. ---- View the other episodes in the “ABCs of Socialism”
