description: 'This final installment of “Labor Now” is focused on union power. Featuring
  Mark Dudzic, Marcus Barnett, and Seth Ackerman. Moderated by Amber A’Lee Frost and
  sponsored by Verso Books and Jacobin. Filmed at Verso Books in Brooklyn, February
  22, 2017. Organizing the workplace is one thing, but the long game for any politicized
  labor movement is to institutionalize worker power and exercise it in the larger
  political sphere; questions of state power, policy, party politics, and the role
  of social democratic reforms should be central to the project of a revived labor
  movement and thus a revived left. However, the labor movement''s attempts to break
  into party politics have yielded very little. The Democratic Party has both weakened
  and moved very steadily to the right, and neither the unions nor the "progressive
  left" have had much luck either fortifying the Dem''s base or significantly influencing
  their policy. Fusion voting experiments like The Working Families Party haven''t
  fared much better, and social issue-oriented projects like the Green Party have
  failed to even make a dent. In a country with no party of the workers, how does
  the labor movement build and exercise power? What is the future of party politics
  for labor? What is the role of labor in the path to socialism? And what is the ideal
  relationship between left political organizations and organized labor? ABOUT THE
  SPEAKERS: Mark Dudzic is a longtime labor activist. He was President of Local 8-149
  OCAW (a branch of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union) for
  18 years, he served as National Organizer for the Labor Party, and he is currently
  the National Coordinator of the Labor Campaign for Single Payer. Marcus Barnett
  is an elected Regional Political Officer for the National Union of Rail, Maritime
  and Transport Workers, he sits on the Executive Committee of London Young Labour,
  and he is active in the Corbyn group, Momentum. He is also a contributor to Jacobin
  magazine. Seth Ackerman is Managing Editor of Jacobin magazine.'
