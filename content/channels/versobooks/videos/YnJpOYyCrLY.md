description: 'David Roediger in conversation with Jordan T. Camp, Christina Heatherton,
  and Donna Murch. New York launch of David Roediger’s latest book, “Class, Race,
  and Marxism,” at Verso Books in Brooklyn on June 30, 2017. https://www.versobooks.com/books/2467-class-race-and-marxism
  Since the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, and the political fault-lines
  opened up by the 2016 US elections, the question of the relationship between race,
  class, and politics in modern societies has dominated the media landscape. In this
  new collection of pathbreaking essays, Roediger tackles the question of race and
  its relationship to capitalism, and through this challenges the way we thinking
  about whiteness and racism, intersectionality, solidarity, and the future of organizing
  against racism. David Roediger’s work over the past 25 years has set the agenda
  for work on the constructions race in US history. His books have defined the field
  of Critical Whiteness Studies, and been hailed by the likes of Angela Davis, Kimberlé
  Crenshaw, Paul Gilroy, and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak. In “Class, Race, and Marxism,”
  Roediger argues that racial division is not only part of the history of capitalism
  but is fundamental to the nature of work and capitalism itself. Class, Race, and
  Marxism is an essential guide to current discussions about race and class that provides
  useful histories for forging solidarity. About David Roediger: David Roediger is
  the Foundation Distinguished Professor of American Studies and History at Kansas
  University. Among his books are “Our Own Time: A History of American Labor and the
