description: 'Adam Tooze, Quinn Slobodian, and Atossa Araxia Abrahamian discuss neoliberalism,
  globalization, and the future of democracy. At Verso Books in Brooklyn, September
  20, 2018. Ten years after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers nearly shattered the
  global economy, basic questions about the worst economic crisis since the Great
  Depression remain unanswered. What drove the accumulation of private debt and financialization
  of the economy that made the downturn possible? Was this a crisis for neoliberalism?
  Given its association with globalization, is a defense of national sovereignty the
  only way to take back democratic control from neoliberal forces? How has this shaped
  the populist revolts now transforming the global order, and how might the left respond?
  --- ABOUT THE SPEAKERS: Adam Tooze is Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Professor
  of History at Columbia University, where he also directs the European Institute.
  He is author of “Crashed: How a Decade of Financial Crises Changed the World.” Quinn
  Slobodian is associate professor of history at Wellesley College. His most recent
  book is “Globalists: The End of Empire and the Birth of Neoliberalism.” Forthcoming
  is “Nine Lives of Neoliberalism” (Verso Books), co-edited with Dieter Plehwe and
  Philip Mirowski. He is currently writing a book with the working title “Hayek’s
  Bastards” on the neoliberal roots of the far right. The conversation is moderated
  by Atossa Araxia Abrahamian, senior editor at the Nation and a contributing editor
  at Dissent.'
