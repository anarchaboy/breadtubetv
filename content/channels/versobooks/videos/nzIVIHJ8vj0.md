description: 'Release party for “In These Times” magazine’s special issue on climate
  change. A panel of climate experts and organizers discuss what an equitable and
  democratic Green New Deal could look like, in New York City and beyond. The Green
  New Deal offers, perhaps for the first time, an ambitious and potentially transformative
  framework for reaching zero emissions by 2030. Yet it’s only a framework, a set
  of goals and principles. This latest issue of “In These Times” aims to fill in that
  framework, inviting expert progressive thinkers to lay out each aspect of the political
  and economic change needed to achieve a just transition. The panelists here address
  questions around the energy transition: What, concretely, will it take to wrest
  our economy off fossil fuels? After local wins such as New York City''s recent Climate
  Mobilization Act, what can activists push for next? And, most importantly, is any
  of this possible under a grow-or-die, market-obsessed capitalist economy? Featuring:
  Kate Aronoff, fellow at the Type Media Center Ashley Dawson, author of “Extreme
  Cities: The Peril and Promise of Urban Life in the Age of Climate Change” (Verso,
  2017) Pete Sikora, climate and inequality campaigns director at New York Communities
  for Change Moderated by Jamie Tyberg, development director at New York Communities
  for Change and co-founder of the Democratic Socialists of America Ecosocialist Working
  Group. Recorded at Verso Books in Brooklyn on May 13, 2019.'
