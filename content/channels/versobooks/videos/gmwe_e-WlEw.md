  Moderated by Maryam Jamshidi. Cosponsored by Verso Books and Muftah Magazine. Filmed
  at Verso Books in Brooklyn, February 10, 2017. ----- On the campaign trail, Donald
  Trump promised a “Muslim Ban.” Well, he just delivered. On January 27, 2017, Trump
  issued a sweeping ban, “temporarily” stopping immigration from seven Muslim-majority
  countries, as well as the refugee settlement program. Syrian refugees, who are among
  the most in need, have been prohibited from coming to the United States indefinitely.
  This will not be the only action Trump takes against Muslims, American or otherwise.
  It is also far from the first time Muslims have been scapegoated in the United States.
  Maryam Jamshidi, Muftah’s editor-in-chief, moderates a discussion about the roots
  of the Muslim Ban, what comes next, and what we can do to fight back against anti-Muslim
  bigotry. The panelists are Mehreen Kasana, a journalist writing about race and religion
  for outlets such as the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times; Moustafa Bayoumi,
  professor at Brooklyn College and author of “This Muslim American Life”; Arun Kundnani,
  scholar-in-residence at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New
  York Public Library, and author of “The Muslims Are Coming!”; and Fahd Ahmed of
  Desis Rising Up and Moving (DRUM).
