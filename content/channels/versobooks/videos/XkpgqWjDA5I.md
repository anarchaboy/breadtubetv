description: With Ceylan Akça, Diego Cupolo, and Nazan Üstündağ. Moderated by Cihan
  Tekay. Filmed at Verso Books in Brooklyn, January 5, 2017. Since the coup attempt
  on July 15, 2016, Turkey’s government has intensified its crackdown on political
  dissidents under an ongoing state of emergency. Thousands of activists, academics,
  journalists and others find themselves subject to mass purges, detentions, and political
  trials that have turned into witch hunts, the latest involving members of parliament
  from the pro-Kurdish People’s Democratic Party (HDP). In a political climate that
  champions “national unity” against “common enemies,” dissenting voices are increasingly
  marginalized and silenced, especially in the wake of massive media blackouts. The
  end of the peace process with Kurdish guerilla forces, the rise of authoritarianism,
  the spread of political violence targeting civilians as well as security forces,
  an ongoing refugee crisis and impending economic collapse make Turkey’s predicament
  evermore complex. This panel will address some of the challenges that the country
  is facing by providing firsthand accounts from activists, journalists and academics
  working on the ground. Ceylan Akça is a Political Adviser for the pro-Kurdish opposition
  party HDP, whose MPs are currently imprisoned. Her work focuses on prisons in Turkey
  and foreign affairs. Diego Cupolo is an independent journalist focusing on conflicts
  in the Middle East and the ongoing refugee crisis. His works have appeared in Foreign
  Policy and the Atlantic. Nazan Üstündağ is Assistant Professor of Sociology at Boğaziçi
  University. Her works are on postcolonial theory, feminist studies, state and violence
  and resistance. She is a founding member of the Peace Parliament and Academics for
  Peace, as well as a member of Women for Peace. Cihan Tekay is a PhD student in Anthropology
  at The Graduate Center, City University of New York. She is currently working on
  a study of the Turkish state through a history of its energy infrastructure. She
  is a co-editor of Jadaliyya’s Turkey page and a member of Academics for Peace.
