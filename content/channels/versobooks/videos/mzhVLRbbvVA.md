date: "2019-10-11T16:14:41+08:00"
type: video
description: 'First in the “ABCs of Socialism” series, featuring lectures and discussions
  with contributors of the “ABCs of Socialism” book. Most people know that socialists
  place the working class at the center of their political vision. But why exactly?
  Because workers are not only a social group that is systematically exploited, they
  are also the group best positioned to enact real change. Vivek Chibber is a professor
  of sociology at New York University. His latest book is “Postcolonial Theory and
  the Specter of Capital.” Filmed at Verso Books in Brooklyn, March 6, 2017. ----
