description: Raising Expectations (And Raising Hell) My Decade Fighting for the Labor
  Movement by Jane McAlevey In this engrossing recollection of her decade fighting
  around-the-clock for the labor movement, the charismatic Jane McAlevey draws on
  her experience and insight to ask what happened to the promise of labor reform following
  former AFL-CIO President John Sweeney's 1995 election—and what can be done to revitalize
  the movement we so desperately need. Raising Expectations argues that labor can
  be revived, but only if the movement acknowledges its mistakes and fully commits
  to deep organizing, participatory education, militancy, and an approach to workers
  and their communities that more resembles the campaigns of the 1930s—in short, social
  movement unionism that involves raising workers' expectations (while raising hell).
