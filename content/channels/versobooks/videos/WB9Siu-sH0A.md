  in Brooklyn, May 3, 2017. Chelsea Manning, source of the biggest classified leak
  in US history, will be released from Fort Leavenworth military prison on May 17,
  her thirty-five-year sentence commuted by President Obama in one of his last acts
  of office. What does her case mean? What impact did her leaks of diplomatic cables
  and war logs from the Iraq and Afghan wars have on US foreign policy, and elsewhere?
  What are the lasting consequences for transgender dignity and justice both in and
  out of the US military? And what does this story of whistleblower martyrdom mean
  in the age of President Trump, who praised Wikileaks on the campaign trail but has
  since vowed to hunt down leakers in his administration? About the speakers: Chase
  Strangio is an ACLU attorney who has represented Manning in her fight for transgender
  justice in military prisons. Chase Madar is a former civil rights lawyer and author
  of “The Passion of [Chelsea] Manning: The Story behind the Wikileaks Whistleblower,”
