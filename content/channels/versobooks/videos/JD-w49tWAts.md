description: 'Over the last decade, tens of billions of pounds have been cut from
  support for disabled people. Disabled people have been hit 9 times harder by austerity
  cuts than the average person, rising to 19 times harder for severely disabled people.
  In this video, Frances Ryan speaks to Rachel and the effects of austerity cuts on
  her care package. She no longer has assistance to clean, get dressed, or into bed.
  She lives off fruit and bread, and is now clinically malnourished. On bad days she
  sleeps in her clothes in her wheelchair. In one of the richest nations on earth,
  we should be able to make sure that all citizens live in safety and dignity. Crippled:
  Austerity and the Demonization of Disabled People by Frances Ryan is out now https://www.versobooks.com/books/2972-crippled
