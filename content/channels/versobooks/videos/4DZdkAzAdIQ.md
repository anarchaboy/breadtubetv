description: 'Asad Haider in conversation with Katie Halper, Robyn Marasco, Wendell
  Hassan Marsh, and Briahna Gray. At Verso Books in Brooklyn, May 15, 2018 “Mistaken
  Identity: Race and Class in the Age of Trump” is available from Verso Books: https://www.versobooks.com/books/2716-mistaken-identity
  Whether class or race is the more important factor in modern politics is a question
  right at the heart of recent history’s most contentious debates. Among groups who
  should readily find common ground, there is little agreement. To escape this deadlock,
  Asad Haider turns to the rich legacies of the black freedom struggle. Drawing on
  the words and deeds of black revolutionary theorists, he argues that identity politics
  is not synonymous with anti-racism, but instead amounts to the neutralization of
  its movements. It marks a retreat from the crucial passage of identity to solidarity,
  and from individual recognition to the collective struggle against an oppressive
  social structure. Weaving together autobiographical reflection, historical analysis,
  theoretical exegesis, and protest reportage, “Mistaken Identity” is a passionate
  call for a new practice of politics beyond colorblind chauvinism and “the ideology
  of race.”'
