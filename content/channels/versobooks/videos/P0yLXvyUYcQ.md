description: 'A discussion about political strategy, featuring: Mark Dudzic, National
  Coordinator, Labor Campaign for Single-Payer Dr. Roona Ray, Board Member and Fellow,
  Physicians for a National Health Program (Metro NY Chapter) Tim Faust, Healthcare
  Advocate and NYC-DSA member Moderated by Sarah Leonard, Features Editor at The Nation
  Sponsored by the DSA Political Education Working Group (Brooklyn) and the NYC-DSA
  Socialist Feminist Working Group. At Verso Books in Brooklyn, November 12, 2017.
  ---- Momentum has been building in support of Medicare-for-All in recent months,
  but the Left must be clear and realistic about the obstacles to enacting meaningful
  reform. We must ask: who are the powerful interests arrayed against Medicare-for-All,
  and how can we most effectively confront—and ultimately overcome—their opposition?
  To that end, we''ve assembled a panel of labor activists, healthcare professionals,
  and socialist political thinkers to shed light on the opposition to Medicare-for-all
  and to strategize about how to achieve a just and universal healthcare system. Join
  NYC-DSA for an evening of discussion and debate on these topics as we prepare for
  our campaign to make adequate healthcare a reality for working people all over the
  country.'
