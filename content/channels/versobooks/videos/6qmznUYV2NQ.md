description: 'A flash panel to address the questions surrounding Donald Trump''s election
  victory. Filmed at Verso Books in Brooklyn, November 9, 2016. Panel participants
  include: Muna Mire, writer and activist Maryam Jamshidi, founder and editor-in-chief
  of Muftah Donna Murch, Associate Professor of history at Rutgers University Ken
  Chen, Executive Director of the Asian American Writers’ Workshop Bhaskar Sunkara,
  founding editor of Jacobin Magazine Moderated by John Nichols, National Affairs
  Correspondent at The Nation The unthinkable has happened. Donald Trump’s bid for
  presidency is no longer a comedic farce but a political reality that should not
  be underestimated or taken lightly. This political upset represents a catastrophic
  blow to working class women, communities of color, immigrants, Muslims, and LGBTQ
  populations. Where do we go from here? What can we do right now to organize for
  the most vulnerable? What political forces can we muster to challenge the Trump
  administration? And how does this election relate to the global shift to the right
  and the rise of fascism at home?'
