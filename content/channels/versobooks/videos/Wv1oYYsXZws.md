description: 'On the eve of International Women’s Day in 2015, the Chinese government
  arrested five feminist activists and jailed them for thirty-seven days. The Feminist
  Five became a global cause célèbre, with Hillary Clinton speaking out on their behalf
  and activists inundating social media with #FreetheFive messages. But the Five are
  only symbols of a much larger feminist movement of civil rights lawyers, labor activists,
  performance artists, and online warriors prompting an unprecedented awakening among
  China’s educated, urban women. In Betraying Big Brother, journalist and scholar
  Leta Hong Fincher argues that the popular, broad-based movement poses the greatest
  challenge to China’s authoritarian regime today. Here Leta Hong Fincher discusses
  how China deals with gender activism with BBC world. https://www.versobooks.com/books/2863-betraying-big-brother'
