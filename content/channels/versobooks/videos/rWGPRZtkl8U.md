  Q&As, with Owen Jones, the author of Chavs: The Demonization of the Working Class.
  Watch and share the video using #VersoVoices for your chance to win a book bundle!
  Thanks to everyone who sent us brilliant questions for Owen! We’ve selected some
  of the best ones for your viewing pleasure. In our inaugural Verso Voices video,
  Owen answers your questions on the future of work and technology, the prison system,
  how the nation’s conversation about class has changed, Spanish politics, Jeremy
  Corbyn and the next election—and what it would take for him to go on a date with
  you! We’re giving away prize bundles of the books you can see behind Owen’s shoulder
  in the video to celebrate the launch of Verso Voices: the new and updated edition
  of Chavs, How Did We Get Into This Mess? by George Monbiot, Outsider in the White
  House by Bernie Sanders, The Ministry of Nostalgia by Owen Hatherley, Out of Time
  by Lynne Segal, Captain Swing by Eric Hobsbawm and The Boy Who Could Save the World
  by Aaron Swartz. Simply share the video tagging Verso Books on Facebook and @VersoBooks
  on Twitter using the hashtag #VersoVoices! This competition is open to UK residents
  only (sorry!) and will run until 12 noon on 1st May GMT.'
