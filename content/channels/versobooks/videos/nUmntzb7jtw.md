description: 'Part 4 of the “ABCs of Socialism” series, sponsored by Verso Books and
  Jacobin, featuring lectures and discussions with contributors of the “ABCs of Socialism”
  book. You’ve probably seen the memes purporting to show just how socialist the United
  States already is by listing a bunch of government programs, services, and agencies.
  The idea that any government activity is synonymous with socialism has major political
  and strategic implications. After all, if our country were already at least partly
  socialist, then all we would have to do is keep gradually expanding government.
  Simply electing politicians to office or watching the government expand by its own
  momentum has never been, and never will be, enough. Economic power is political
  power, and under capitalism the owners of capital will always have the capacity
  to undermine popular democracy—no matter who’s in Congress or the White House. About
  the speaker: Chris Maisano is a contributing editor at Jacobin and a union staffer
  in New York. ---- View the other episodes in the “ABCs of Socialism” series: “Why
