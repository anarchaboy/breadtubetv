description: 'As the world around us increases in technological complexity, our understanding
  of it diminishes. Underlying this trend is a single idea: the belief that our existence
  is understandable through computation, and more data is enough to help us build
  a better world. In his brilliant new work, leading artist and writer James Bridle
  surveys the history of art, technology, and information systems, and reveals the
  dark clouds that gather over our dreams of the digital sublime.'
