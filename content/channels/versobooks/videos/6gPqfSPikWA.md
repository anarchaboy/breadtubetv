description: 'Anna Feigenbaum, author of “Tear Gas: From the Battlefields of WWI to
  the Streets of Today,” in conversation with L.A. Kauffman, Mark Bray, Ali Issa,
  and Ajay Singh Chaudhary. At Verso Books in Brooklyn, November 8, 2017. How has
  tear gas gone from the battlefields of WWI to the most commonly used form of “less-lethal”
  police force? How can activists today learn from the history of chemical weapons
  used to suppress political dissent and labor strikes? How might we build campaigns
  against the profiting off protest? Join a panel of writers, scholars and activists
  who will discuss their work and personal experiences organizing in the face of state
  repression. This discussion will commemorate the launch of Anna Feigenbaum’s new
  book, “Tear Gas: From the Battlefields of WWI to the Streets of Today.” An engrossing
  century-spanning narrative, “Tear Gas” is the first history of this weapon, and
  takes us from military labs and chemical weapons expos to union assemblies and protest
  camps, drawing on declassified reports and witness testimonies to show how policing
  with poison came to be. Co-sponsored by Melville House and the Brooklyn Institute
  for Social Research. “Tear Gas: From the Battlefields of WWI to the Streets of Today,”
  is available from Verso Books: https://www.versobooks.com/books/2109-tear-gas ABOUT
