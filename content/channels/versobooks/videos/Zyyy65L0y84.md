description: 'Author Peter Frase in conversation with Alyssa Battistoni at Verso Books
  in Brooklyn, October 13, 2016. Join Jacobin and Verso Books for the official launch
  of Jacobin Editor Peter Frase''s Four Futures: Life After Capitalism. One thing
  we can be certain of is that capitalism will end. Maybe not soon, but probably before
  too long; humanity has never before managed to craft an eternal social system, after
  all, and capitalism is a notably more precarious and volatile order than most of
  those that preceded it. The question, then, is what will come next? In Four Futures,
  Frase imagines how this post-capitalist world might look, deploying the tools of
  both social science and speculative fiction to explore what communism, rentism and
  extermininsm might actually entail. Could the current rise of the real-life robocops
  usher in a world that resembles Ender''s Game? And sure, communism will bring an
  end to material scarcities and inequalities of wealth—but there''s no guarantee
  that social hierarchies, governed by an economy of "likes," wouldn''t rise to take
  their place. A whirlwind tour through science fiction, social theory and the new
  technologies are already shaping our lives, Four Futures is a balance sheet of the
  socialisms we may reach if a resurgent Left is successful, and the barbarisms we
  may be consigned to if those movements fail. — Four Futures is part of Verso''s
  Jacobin series, featuring short interrogations of politics, economics, and culture
  from a socialist perspective. The books offer critical analysis and engagement with
  the history and ideas of the Left in an accessible format. More on Four Futures:
