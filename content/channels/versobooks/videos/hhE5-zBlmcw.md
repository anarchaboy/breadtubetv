description: '“Good in theory, bad in practice.” Sure, the concept sounds nice, but
  people aren’t very nice, right? Isn’t capitalism much more suited to human nature—a
  nature dominated by competitiveness and venality? Socialists don’t believe these
  truisms. They don’t view history as a mere chronicle of cruelty and selfishness.
  They also see countless acts of empathy, reciprocity, and love. People are complex:
  they do unspeakable things, but they also engage in remarkable acts of kindness
  and, even in difficult situations, show deep regard for others. Adaner Usmani is
  a graduate student at New York University and on the board of “New Politics.” Filmed
  at Verso Books in Brooklyn, March 14, 2017. ---- This is the second in the “ABCs
  of Socialism” series, sponsored by Verso Books and Jacobin, featuring lectures and
  discussions with contributors of the “ABCs of Socialism” book. View the other episodes
