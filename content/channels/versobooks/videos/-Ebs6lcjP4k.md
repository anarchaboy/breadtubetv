description: 'Leta Hong Fincher, Rebecca Karl, and Lü Pin discuss contemporary feminist
  organizing in China against the authoritarian, patriarchal Xi Jinping administration.
  In partnership with NüVoices Network. Recorded at Verso Books in Brooklyn on November
  2, 2018. The book, “Betraying Big Brother: The Feminist Awakening in China”, is
  available from Verso: https://www.versobooks.com/books/2863-betraying-big-brother
  Called “fascinating and earnest” by Publishers Weekly, “Betraying Big Brother” follows
  the story of the Feminist Five, five leading Chinese feminist activists who were
  arrested, detained, and tortured by the regime in 2015. But the Five are only symbols
  of a much larger feminist movement of university students, civil rights lawyers,
  labor activists, performance artists, and online warriors prompting an unprecedented
  awakening among China’s educated, urban women. Tracing the rise of a new feminist
  consciousness now finding expression through the #MeToo movement, and describing
  how the Communist regime has suppressed the history of its own feminist struggles,
  “Betraying Big Brother” is a story of how the movement against patriarchy could
  reconfigure China and the world. ABOUT THE SPEAKERS: Leta Hong Fincher is a scholar,
  journalist and author of “Betraying Big Brother: The Feminist Awakening in China”
  (Verso 2018). Her first book was the critically acclaimed “Leftover Women: The Resurgence
  of Gender Inequality in China” (Zed 2014). She is the first American to receive
  a Ph.D. from Tsinghua University’s Department of Sociology in Beijing and has written
  for the New York Times, Washington Post, The Guardian, Dissent, Ms. Magazine and
  others. Leta was a Mellon Visiting Assistant Professor at Columbia University and
  recently moved to New York Rebecca E. Karl teaches history at New York University
  (in New York). Books include “The Magic of Concepts: History and the Economic in
  Twentieth-Century China,” “Mao Zedong and China in the Twentieth-Century World:
  A Brief History,” and a co-edited/co-translated volume, with Lydia Liu and Dorothy
  Ko, “The Birth of Chinese Feminism: Essential Texts in Transnational Theory.” The
  latter introduces to an English-language audience the little-known anarchist-feminist
  from early 20th-century China, He-Yin Zhen, through a systematic translation of
  her major essays and a thorough analysis of her vital theorization of feminism for
  China’s and the world’s modern age. Forthcoming is a small volume, to be published
  by Verso, tentatively entitled “China’s Revolutions: From Then to Now.” Lü Pin（吕频）is
  a Chinese feminist activist focusing on strategic advocacy to combat gender-based
  discrimination and violence. She started her work on women’s rights in the late
  1990s. In 2009, she founded Feminist Voices, China’s largest new media platform
  on women’s issues. Since 2012, she has been devoted to supporting the activism of
  young feminists across China. She now resides in Albany, New York, where she continues
  to follow the feminist movement in China closely.'
