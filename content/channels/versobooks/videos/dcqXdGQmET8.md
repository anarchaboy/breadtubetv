description: 'Kate Evans discusses her new book Threads: From the Refugee Crisis,
  a work of visual reportage through the medium of comic-book storytelling - and makes
  a compelling case for the compassionate treatment of refugees and the free movement
  of peoples. "We need to question why there are migrants, why it is happening, what
  is it about the state of the world which is displacing so many people. We need to
  question militarism, we need to be noticing climate change and the factor that it
  plays in wars as well as other forms of displacement. "It blows apart this distinction
  between the economic migrant and political refugee, when you consider that large
  parts of the planet are becoming uninhabitable."'
