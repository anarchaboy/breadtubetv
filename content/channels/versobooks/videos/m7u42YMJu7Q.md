  explains how political impotence and humiliation is used to manipulate citizens
  into supporting figures like Trump and Farage. But rather than despair, we should
  see in this social and political deadlock a catalyst for change, and imagine possibilities
  for alternative futures free from wage labor, exploitation and the oppression of
  global corporate capitalism. To celebrate the publication of Bifo Berardi’s new
  book Futurability: The Age of Impotence and the Horizon of Possibility, we’re offering
  40% off all books on our ''Horizon of Possibility'' reading list. Sale ends July
