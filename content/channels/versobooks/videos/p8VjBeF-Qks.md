description: 'Join Verso Books, Muftah, and the Brooklyn Institute for Social Research
  for the launch of Kate Evans’s new graphic novel, “Threads: From the Refugee Crisis”
  and a wide-ranging discussion on the refugee crisis in Syria and the Middle East.
  Evans volunteered at the refugee camp in Calais, France, also known as “The Jungle”
  in late 2015/early 2016 and recounts the stories of many of the people she met there,
  all while arguing for the compassionate treatment of refugees and the free movement
  of peoples. Evans is joined in conversation by journalist and Syrian rights activist
  Loubna Mrie, Maryam Jamshidi of Muftah.org, and Anthony Alessandrini of the Brooklyn
  Institute for Social Research. They discuss the wider context of the civil war in
  Syria, Western media portrayals of the refugee crisis, and the role of the US War
  on Terror in exacerbating the forced migration of people from war torn regions.
  Filmed at Verso Books in Brooklyn on September 19, 2017. “Threads: From The Refugee
  Crisis” is available from Verso Books: https://www.versobooks.com/books/2458-threads

  with incisive analysis on countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) that
  eschewed the Western media’s focus on terrorism, oil, and Islamism, and highlighted
  the complex factors that shape and influence regional countries and populations.
  Since then, we have extended our coverage to Central Asia and Eastern Europe, and
  plan to keep expanding to other parts of the globe that are similarly misunderstood
  and misrepresented by mainstream media outlets. The Brooklyn Institute for Social
  Research is an interdisciplinary teaching and research institute that offers critical,
  community-based education in the humanities and social sciences. Working in partnership
  with local businesses and cultural organizations, we integrate rigorous but accessible
  scholarly study with the everyday lives of working adults and re-imagine scholarship
  for the 21st century.'
