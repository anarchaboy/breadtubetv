description: 'In this interview, Priyamvada Gopal explains the ideas and theories
  behind her book Insurgent Empire: Anticolonial Resistance and British Dissent Much
  has been written on how colonial subjects took up British and European ideas and
  turned them against empire when making claims to freedom and self-determination.
  The possibility of reverse influence has been largely overlooked. Insurgent Empire
  shows how Britainâ€™s enslaved and colonial subjects were not merely victims of empire
  but also agents whose resistance both contributed to their own liberation and shaped
  British ideas about freedom and who could be free. This book examines dissent over
  the question of empire in Britain and shows how it was influenced by rebellions
  and resistance in the colonies from the West Indies and East Africa to Egypt and
  India. It also shows how a pivotal role in fomenting dissent was played by anticolonial
  campaigners based in London, at the heart of the empire. Insurgent Empire: Anticolonial
  Resistance and British Dissent is out now https://www.versobooks.com/books/2965-insurgent-empire'
