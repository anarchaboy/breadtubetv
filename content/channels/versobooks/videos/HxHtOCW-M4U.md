  Aschoff in conversation with Liza Featherstone at Powerhouse Arena Brooklyn, NY
  4/20/15 Video by Anthony Simon (http://anthonysimon.net/) Mythmaking is as central
  to sustaining our economy as proft-making, particularly as severe environmental
  degradation, breathtaking inequality, and increasing alienation among youth push
  capitalism against its own contradictions. Enter the new prophets of capital. In
  this moment of crisis, a new generation of wealthy mythmakers, masquerading as progressive
  thinkers, has emerged to reinvent the free market as the solution to society’s problems.
  With Oprah rallying the poor to bootstrap their way into the middle class; Sheryl
  Sandberg calling on women to “lean in” to the unequal demands of a sexist world;
  and Bill and Melinda Gates offering the generosity of the 1 percent as the solution
  to a persistent, systemic inequality, the new prophets of capital buttress the exploitative
  system, even as the cracks grow more visible. If we are serious about addressing
  the miseries and anxieties on which these prophets prey, Nicole Aschoff argues we
  must give up our belief in the inevitability of the capitalist system that they
  mythologize. For the New York launch of this new title in the Jacobin series, Aschoff
  joined journalist Liza Featherstone in conversation at the Powerhouse Arena in Brooklyn,
  NY'
