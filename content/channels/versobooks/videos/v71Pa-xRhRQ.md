description: 'With Robin D.G. Kelley, Vijay Prashad, and Christina Heatherton. At
  Verso Books in Brooklyn, May 24, 2018. Walter Rodney’s “The Russian Revolution”
  is available from Verso Books: https://www.versobooks.com/books/2724-the-russian-revolution
  --- In his short life, Guyanese intellectual Walter Rodney emerged as one of the
  foremost thinkers and activists of the anti colonial revolution, leading movements
  in North America, Africa, and the Caribbean, Wherever he was, Rodney was a lighting
  rod for working-class Black Power organizing. His deportation sparked Jamaica’s
  Rodney Riots in 1968, and his scholarship trained a generation how to approach politics
  on an international scale. In 1980, shortly after founding the Working People’s
  Alliance in Guyana, the thirty-eight-year-old Rodney was assassinated. Walter Rodney’s
  “The Russian Revolution” collects surviving texts from a series of lectures he delivered
  at the University of Dar Es Salaam, an intellectual hub of the independent Third
  World. It had been his intention to work these into a book, a goal completed posthumously
  with the editorial aid of Robin D.G. Kelley and Jesse Benjamin. Moving across the
  historiography of the long Russian Revolution with clarity and insight, Rodney transcends
  the ideological fault lines of the Cold War. Surveying a board range of subjects—the
  Narodniks, social democracy, the October Revolution, civil war, and the challenges
  of Stalinism–Rodney articulates a distinct viewpoint from the Third World, one that
  grounds revolutionary theory and history with the people in motion.'
