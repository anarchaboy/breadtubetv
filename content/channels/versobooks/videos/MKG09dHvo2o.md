  Organization and Solidarity. Hosted at Verso Books in Brooklyn on January 27, 2017.
  As Trump enters the White House, millions of people are looking for a way to fight
  back against what is sure to be an all-out assault on the rights of women, people
  of color, the LGBTQ community, immigrants, and the working class as a whole. Our
  effectiveness in the struggle ahead requires clear strategy and tactics and a commitment
  to work together to cohere a strong socialist pole of attraction within the emerging
  movements against oppression and austerity. Following the historic national mass
  mobilizations taking place during the inauguration weekend, the Democratic Socialists
  of America, the International Socialist Organization and Solidarity invite you to
  join us for a comradely discussion and debate on the next steps for socialists in
  the Trump era. SPEAKERS: Charlie Post, a longtime socialist activist and an activist
  in the staff union at CUNY Jen Roesch, organizer in the International Socialist
  Organization and frequent contributor to Socialist Worker, the International Socialist
  Review and Jacobin Magazine Bhaskar Sunkara, vice chair of the Democratic Socialists
  of America and editor of Jacobin Magazine'
