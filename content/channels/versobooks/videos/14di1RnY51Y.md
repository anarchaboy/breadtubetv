description: 'Conspiracy theories are a symptom of our new dark age. The last 100
  years of computation shows us that big data is always insufficient. We’ve completely
  undermined any trust in traditional sources of authority but we’ve also spent the
  last 50 years undercutting our understanding of the world by making technology and
