description: 'Author Natasha Lennard in conversation with Rachel Rosenfelt. “Being
  Numerous: Essays on Non-Fascist Life” shatters the mainstream consensus on politics
  and personhood, offering in its place a bracing analysis of a perilous world and
  how we should live in it. Beginning with an interrogation of what it means to fight
  fascism, Natasha Lennard explores the limits of individual rights, the criminalization
  of political dissent, the myths of radical sex, and the ghosts in our lives. At
  once politically committed and philosophically capacious, “Being Numerous” is a
  revaluation of the idea that the personal is political, and situates as the central
  question of our time—How can we live a non-fascist life? Natasha Lennard is a Contributing
  Writer for the Intercept, and her work has appeared regularly in the New York Times,
  Nation, Esquire, Vice, Salon, and the New Inquiry, among others. She teaches Critical
  Journalism at the New School for Social Research and coauthored Violence: Humans
  in Dark Times with Brad Evans. Rachel Rosenfelt is Founding Editor of the New Inquiry
  and Dark Inquiry. She teaches Creative Publishing and Critical Journalism at The
  New School. “Being Numerous” is available from Verso Books: https://www.versobooks.com/books/2949-being-numerous'
