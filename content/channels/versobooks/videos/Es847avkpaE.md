description: 'March 21, 2016, at Verso Books in Brooklyn Built on the legacies of
  slavery, Jim Crow segregation, housing discrimination, predatory lending practices,
  and mass criminalization, America''s economic system has continued to systematically
  fail Black communities for generations. Envisioned, written, and published by the
  young Black people of BYP100, the Agenda to Build Black Futures is a set of economic
  goals and structural changes that could improve the lives of Black people in the
  United States. What could reparations for chattel slavery look like in the 21st
  century? What do reproductive justice, gender self-determination, and ending mass
  incarceration have to do with economic justice? Is any of this really possible?
  Join BYP100, Dissent Magazine, Verso Books, New Economy Coalition, and Grasping
  at the Root for a panel discussion in conversation with the Agenda as we discuss
  what a multi-dimensional plan for Black economic justice could look like in the
  current moment. Panelists: Janae Bonsu, National Public Policy Chair, BYP100 Imani
  Brown, NYC Chapter Co-Chair, BYP100 Darrick Hamilton, Professor of Economics and
  Urban Policy at the New School Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, author of From #BlackLivesMatter
  to Black Liberation The conversation is moderated by Mychal Denzel Smith, author
  of Invisible Man, Got the Whole World Watching, forthcoming from Nation Books. Read
