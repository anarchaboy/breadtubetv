description: 20% of the poorest people in the UK don't have access to the internet
  at home. This digital deprivation effects access to benefits and services, and means
  we are no longer hearing the voices of the poorest people in this country. Stephen
  Armstrong explores the new landscape of poverty in the UK in his new book, The New
  Poverty.
