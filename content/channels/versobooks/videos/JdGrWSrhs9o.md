type: video
description: 'With the propagandist narratives Russia and the United States have created
  about each other over the last few years, it has become difficult to identify objective
  facts, even if they actually exist. US media coverage of the Russian hacking allegations
  is the most recent example of this. In this panel discussion, we hope to shed some
  light on the various narratives Russia and the United States have been using against
  one another, including about the DNC hack, the Ukraine crisis, and the civil war
  in Syria. Sponsored by Muftah Magazine and Verso Books. Filmed at Verso Books in
  Brooklyn, March 1, 2017. Panelists: Nina Khrushcheva, Russia expert, professor at
  the New School, and great-granddaughter of Nikita Khrushchev Melissa Hooper, expert
  on legal and civil society issues in the countries of the former Soviet Union and
  director of civil society and human rights at Human Rights First Sam Biddle, journalist
  at the Intercept who has written extensively on the Russian hacking controversy.
  The moderator is Maryam Jamshidi, editor-in-chief of Muftah Magazine.'
