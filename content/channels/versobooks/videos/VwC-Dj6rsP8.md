description: It is inescapable that those determining the shape of our choices when
  engaging with Information Technology are physically and culturally located in a
  very small region. Apple, Facebook, and Google are within a stones throw of each
  other, and even though they recruit from all over the world, there is an astonishing
  physic self-similarity among the people who work there, whatever their national
  or cultural origin." - Adam Greenfield, author of Radical Technologie
