description: 'Author George Ciccariello-Maher in conversation with Greg Grandin at
  Verso Books in Brooklyn, October 4, 2016. Join Jacobin and Verso Books books for
  the official launch of George Ciccariello-Maher’s “Building the Commune: Radical
  Democracy in Venezuela.” Since 2011, a wave of popular mobilizations has swept the
  globe, from Occupy to the Arab Spring, 15M in Spain and the uprisings in Greece.
  Their demands were varied, but what they share is a commitment to ideals of radical
  democracy, and a willingness to experiment with new forms of organization to achieve
  this. In fact, the countries of Latin America have been experimenting with such
  projects since 1989—just as left projects of all stripes fell into decline across
  Europe—in what was a moment of rebirth. Poor residents of Venezuela’s barrios took
  history into their own hands in a mass popular rebellion against neoliberalism,
  much as the movements appearing worldwide are doing today. In Building the Commune,
  George Ciccariello-Maher travels through the many radical experiments of Venezuela,
  assessing how they have succeeded and failed, and how they are continuing to operate.
  Speaking to community members, workers, students and government officials, Ciccariello-Maher
  provides a balance sheet of these projects, that movements throughout the world
  can look to for lessons and inspiration. Building the Commune is part of Verso''s
  Jacobin series, featuring short interrogations of politics, economics, and culture
  from a socialist perspective. The books offer critical analysis and engagement with
  the history and ideas of the Left in an accessible format. More on Building the
