description: 'Thanks to Title IX cases, #MeToo, and #Times Up, the issue of rape seems
  to be constantly in the news. But our thinking on the subject has a long history,
  one that cultural critic Mithu Sanyal elegantly reconstructs. She narrates a history
  spanning from Lucretia—whose legendary rape and suicide was said to be the downfall
  of the last Roman king—to second-wave feminism, Tarzan, and Roman Polanski. Sanyal
  demonstrates that the way we understand rape is remarkably (and alarmingly) consistent
  across the ages, even though the world has changed beyond recognition. It is high
  time for a new and informed debate about sexual violence, sexual boundaries, and
  consent. Mithu Sanyal shows that our comprehension of rape is closely connected
  to our understanding of sex, sexuality, and gender. Why is it that we expect victims
  to be irreparably damaged? When we think of rapists, why do we think of strangers
  rather than uncles, husbands, priests, or boyfriends? And in the era of #MeToo,
  what should “justice” look like? Rape: From Lucretia to #MeToo examines the role
  of race and the recurrent image of the black rapist, the omission of male victims,
  and what we mean when we talk about “rape culture.” Sanyal takes on every received
  opinion we have about rape, arguing with liberals, conservatives, and feminists
  alike. It is out now https://www.versobooks.com/books/2922-rape Mithu Sanyal is
  an award-winning broadcaster, academic and author. Her first book, Vulva, was translated
  into five languages.'
