date: "2019-09-15T10:39:53+08:00"
description: 'L.A. Kauffman in conversation with Frances Fox Piven, Maurice Mitchell,
  and Ana Maria Archila on the state of contemporary movements and how to transform
  resistance into real victories in 2019 and beyond. We''re living through an era
  not just of extraordinary peril but of extraordinary response. More Americans have
  taken part in protests since Trump took office than at any prior time in U.S. history,
  and grassroots hustle—much of it outside the structures of the Democratic Party—swayed
  election after election to the left during the November 2018 midterms. How do we
  evaluate what we''ve achieved over these two years of intensive organizing, and
  what strategies will prove most effective in the months and years ahead? What roles
  should such disparate approaches as protest and direct action, community organizing,
  and electoral advocacy play in building movement power and leveraging that power
  to concrete gains? Longtime movement insider and historian L.A. Kauffman -- author
  of DIRECT ACTION (Verso, 2017) and HOW TO READ A PROTEST (UC Press, 2018)—will lead
  a conversation on these urgent questions with three leading thinkers and organizers
  of our time: FRANCES FOX PIVEN is one of the country''s most influential scholars
  of social movements as well as an accomplished political organizer. She is a Distinguished
  Professor Emerita of Political Science and Sociology at the Graduate Center of City
  University of New York. Piven is the author of co-author of numerous highly acclaimed
  books on American politics, including REGULATING THE POOR: THE FUNCTIONS OF PUBLIC
  WELFARE; POOR PEOPLE''S MOVEMENTS: WHY THEY SUCCEED, WHY THEY FAIL; WHY AMERICANS
  DON''T VOTE, AND WHY POLITICIANS LIKE IT THAT WAY; and CHALLENGING AUTHORITY: HOW
  ORDINARY PEOPLE CHANGE AMERICA. MAURICE MITCHELL is the Executive Director of the
  Working Families Party, bringing more than 20 years of experience in community organizing,
  electoral politics, and social movements to this role. His past work includes serving
  as Organizing Director for Citizen Action of New York and, in the wake of the police
  killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, co-founding and managing Blackbird,
  an anchor organization within the Movement for Black Lives that provides strategic
  support and guidance to groups and individuals throughout the country. ANA MARIA
  ARCHILA is the Co-Executive Director of the Center for Popular Democracy. A longtime
  community organizer and advocate for immigrant rights, she previously served as
  Executive Director of Make the Road New York. Archila''s work to oppose the Supreme
  Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh made global headlines after she and a fellow
  activist confronted Senator Jeff Flake in an elevator last September, challenging
  him to listen to the voices and objections of sexual assault survivors. Beer, wine,
  and seltzer will be available. Co-hosted by University of California Press and the
  Working Families Party'
