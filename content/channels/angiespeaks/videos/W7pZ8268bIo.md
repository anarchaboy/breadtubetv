description: There's no better way to start off the spooky month of October than to
  join me as I interview David from the amazing Left Tube horror analysis channel,
  "Nightmare Masterclass". Today we will be discussing The Horror Genre (specifically
  Arthouse Horror) and what this new wave of popularity the genre is experiencing
  says about our current political/ social moment. We will also be discussing feminism
  in horror, the power of the absurd, surrealism and Petscop. Subscribe to Nightmare
