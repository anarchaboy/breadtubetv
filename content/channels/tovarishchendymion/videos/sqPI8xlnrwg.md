title: Truth about The Tiananmen Square Protests

description: 'Some interesting facts about the Tiananmen Square "massacre"/ so called
  pro-democracy protests of 1989. Slight clarifications, socialist songs were sung
  because socialist sentiment was popular. The leaders were playing on that. The election
  that was taking place in the video was not elections of leaders, but elections of
  diplomats to speak to the government. I probably pronounced the names horribly wrong.
