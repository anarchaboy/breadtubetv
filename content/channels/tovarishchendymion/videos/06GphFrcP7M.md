description: 'Socialism vs Capitalism: Why the Values of Society Assume Socialism
  In the debate socialism vs capitalism, it mainly comes down to which system can
  best satisfy the values we hold dear. Since a socialist planed economy can focus
  on these values, it has more potential to satisfy these values. Therefore with socialism
  vs capitalism, the core assumptions of society come down on the socialist side of
  things. Sources: Economic development, political-economic system, and the physical
