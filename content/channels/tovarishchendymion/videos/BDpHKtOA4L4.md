description: Income inequality is good'. Responding to the 'Income Inequality is Good'
  video from PraguerU. I demonstrate why the claim "income inequality is a good" is
  absurd. PragerU's arguments in favor of income inequality are equally absurd and
  ignorant. I present studies from income inequality in America that demonstrate the
  harmful effects of income inequality. PragerU's defense of income inequality fails
  to understand what inequality of income means or entails. Along with totally misunderstanding
  what advocates of income equality argue
