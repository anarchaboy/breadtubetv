description: 'Analyzing Stalin''s great purge and mass repressions. The great purge
  is blamed on Stalin, yet the assumptions of this great purge model are baseless.
  Stalin''s great purge and great terror were really not controlled by Stalin. I recorded
  this at 2am and sleep deprived so I sometimes mispronounce words. Zukov quote: http://tinyurl.com/y75k684d
  http://militera.lib.ru/memo/russian/zhukov1/09.html google translate version: "Incidentally,
  I was convinced during the war, I. V. Stalin was not such a person, to whom it was
  impossible to raise sensitive issues and with which it would be impossible to argue
  and even firmly defend its point of view.:" American Government censoring free speech:
