description: 'Starvation and communism have become linked due to food shortages during
  the 1980s-1990s and during the 30s. Yet starvation under communism is simply a meme
  with no basis in reality. I refute the claims of constant starvation/food shortages/food
  problems within the USSR. Food shortages in the Soviet Union are explained by the
  problems with modernizing the economy (Kulak terrorism and the needed focus on heavy
  industry). Food shortages were not a constant problem for the USSR/Soviet Union.
  They were solved which gave rise to calorie consumption. Along with showing starvation
  is better linked with capitalism. Starvation and food problems/shortages under the
  Soviet Union pale in comparison to starvation under capitalism Learn the Immortal
