description: '3 Problems with the Non-Aggression Principle (NAP). The Non Aggression
  Principle (NAP) is based on idealism which presents a ton of problems for it. Adding
  the Non Aggression Principle to the definition of capitalism leaves us with absurd
  consequences. This video debunks the non aggression principle concept of capitalism
  because it depends on idealism. Such problems for the Non Aggression Principle include
  *Obtaining Capitalism without changes within the physical *Ambiguity of aggression
  *Ambiguity of society A better definition would then be one rooted in the material
  and not the ideal. This video is refuting a specific type of capitalism that many
  anarcho capitalists and voluntarists believe. Dubbed "non aggression principle capitalism".
  It''s not meant to debunk capitalism as a whole, just this specific type of "non
  aggression principle" capitalism. David Chalmers on P-zombies: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK1Yo6VbRoo
