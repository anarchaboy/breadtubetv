  Douglas Lain flirts with the idea of joining the Cult of Murray in this video while
  working to rehabilitate Hegel’s notion of Spirit or Geist. Can we overcome ourselves
  by embracing the contradiction of modern life? Zero Books Logo Animations and other

  Zero Books Manifesto: The modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across
  our smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical
  thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle
  and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation
  and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend.'
