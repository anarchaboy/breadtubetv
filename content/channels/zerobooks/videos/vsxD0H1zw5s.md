title: Are Humans "Becoming Animal"
date: "2019-10-11T16:24:22+08:00"
type: video
description: This video is in response to both the EDA's book "Why are Animals Funny"
  and Eugene Thacker's "Tentacles Longer than Night." The move towards the animal,
  the desire for the attainment of animal consciousness, is a move away from the depths
  of our responsibility as humans. It is not a way to escape from meaning, but is
  instead a move to naturalize and so obscure our view of the meanings and structures
  we produce and reproduce every day. Why are Animals Funny? http://www.zero-books.net/books/why-animals-funny

  Some of the music in this video was made by Jukedeck http://jukedeck.com
