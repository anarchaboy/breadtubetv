  Therapist with a Lacanian bent living in New York City. He is a returning guest
  and was on the opposite side of Zero Books panel/debate at this year’s Left Forum.
  In this episode we almost discuss Avital Ronnell, postmodernism, and Lacan.
  We’ve started a Zero Books reading group for our patrons. It runs $15 a month on
  Patreon and the first book on our list is Anselm Jappe’s The Writing on the Wall.

  discussion. All of our supporters get access to the Symptomatic Redness and Alternatives
  podcasts, and patrons who donate five dollars a month or higher get access to Inside

   Zero Books Manifesto:  The modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll
  across our smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical
  thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle
  and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation
  and atomization.   Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend."
