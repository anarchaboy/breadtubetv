title: Debating Richard Spencer
date: "2019-10-11T16:24:14+08:00"
type: video
description: Taking our cue from Angela Nagle, author of Kill All Normies, this Zero
  Books video addresses an assertion made by the white nationalist Richard Spencer.
  While the journalist Gary Younge refused to engage Spencer's assertion that African
  benefitted from their encounters with "white supremacy" during a recent interview,
  this video attempts to refute the assertion while pointing out the political dangers
  involved in conflating capitalism with whiteness. (This is a slight re-edit in order
  to make the video available in the UK and Ireland) Kill All Normies by Angela Nagle
