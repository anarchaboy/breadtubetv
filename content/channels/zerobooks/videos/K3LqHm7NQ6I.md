type: video
description: 'This video suggests that postmodernism is a conservative philosophy.
  The books covered include Hal Foster’s The Anti-Aesthetic, Mark Fisher’s Capitalist
  Realism, and Matt McManus’ upcoming What Is Postmodern Conservatism? We take a look
  at the difference between parody and pastiche, the difference between Madonna and
  Tommy Smothers, the genius of Richard Linklater’s movie Slacker, and the nostalgia
  of Douglas Lain. Zero Books Logo Animations and other animations donated by Brian

  at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited
  to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend.'
