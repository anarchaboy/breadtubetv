  http://bit.ly/SubZeroBooks Joanna Demers’ essay “The Necks and Marx''s Economy of
  Time” asks what kind of music helps us to imagine a break with capitalist logic.
  Her answer is simple: Minimalism. Demers’ is chair of Musicology at the USC Thornton
  School of Music and the author of the books Drone and Apocalypse and Anatomy of
  Thought Fiction. In this video essay, she explores Marxism’s commitment to the future,
  the teleology at work in our linear orientation, and the promise of timelessness.

  Zero Books Manifesto: The modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across
  our smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical
  thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle
  and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation
  and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend.'
