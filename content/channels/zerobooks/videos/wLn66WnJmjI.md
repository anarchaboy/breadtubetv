  http://www.zero-books.net/books/against-capital Zero Books Manifesto: The modern
  world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and weâ€™re
  invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to
  find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has
  sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. Zer0
  Books wants to work against this trend.'
