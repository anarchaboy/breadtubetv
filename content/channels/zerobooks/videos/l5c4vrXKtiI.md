  http://bit.ly/SubZeroBooks The Intellectual Dark Web brand claims to be a motley
  crew of ideologically opposed truth tellers but is instead a group of warriors for
  the status quo who are unified around scapegoating leftists and specifically Marxists
  for problems that capitalism itself generates. They claim to want open and rigorous
  debate but duck every opportunity to engage with serious critics. The intellectual
  dark web is afraid of Marx. Watch the most popular Zero Books episodes: http://bit.ly/2KbC2hF

  Zero Books Manifesto: The modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across
  our smartphone screens and weâ€™re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical
  thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle
  and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation
  and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend.'
