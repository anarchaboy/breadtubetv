title: Chomsky vs Žižek (Electric Dreams and Real Life)
date: "2019-10-11T16:24:10+08:00"
type: video
description: 'This video is part one of a two-part exploration of modernism. It explores
  the television program Electric Dreams, and specifically the episode ''Real Life''
  as it sets up some ontological concepts in preparation for a video that will consider
  whether a radical change as, defined by the modernism, is possible. Before we ask
  that question we first have to answer questions like: How do we test the limits
  of what we can know about the social world? Do our theories have to be falsifiable
  in a positivist sense? And, secretly, we''ll ask "Shall we be Kantians?"'
