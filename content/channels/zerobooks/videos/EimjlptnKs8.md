  http://bit.ly/SubZeroBooks This video is from Brian Francis Culkin author of The
  Meaning of Trump. His book is an ideological critique that sees the election of
  Donald Trump as a completely natural progression to the general trajectory of digitized
  technologies, neoliberalism, and a new breed of financialized capitalism; destructive
  global forces that know no party affiliation or national boundary. Books Covered

  Zero Books Manifesto: The modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across
  our smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical
  thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle
  and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation
  and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend.'
