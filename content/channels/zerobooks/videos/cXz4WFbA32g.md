description: "Peter Berard is a doctoral candidate in history at Boston College. He
  is also a writer for publications such as Jacobin and the LA Review of books. Berard
  and I discuss the Black Bloc and Antifa tactics in an effort to take a more sympathetic
  look at these anarchist tacticians, although the conversation here is not entirely
  uncritical.  -Video Upload powered by https://www.TunesToTube.com"
