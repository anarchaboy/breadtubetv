  http://bit.ly/SubZeroBooks This video explores how the philosophy of science is
  struggling with deep epistemic difficulties and how “postmodernism” in the philosophy
  of science was a reaction against Marxist ideas. Popper’s falsification theory,
  the ideas of Imre Lakatos, and the need to understand Marxist ideas and the left
  generally in terms of a long term struggle to realize the values of the Enlightenment
  are all covered. Watch the most popular Zero Books episodes: http://bit.ly/2KbC2hF

  is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited
  to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend.'
