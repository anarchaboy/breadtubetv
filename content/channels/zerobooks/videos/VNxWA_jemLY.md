type: video
description: In this youtube video we’ll explore the crisis known as capitalism, that
  is we’ll look at the continued economic crisis, the failed protest movements, the
  retro digital culture, the psychotic businessmen, and even those pesky Russian cyberterrorists,
  only we’ll be looking at all of it through the lens of a TV cult hit from the USA
  television network. The show is “Mr. Robot” and the question that confronts us is
  whether Rami Malek and Christian Slater are stuck the same capitalist realist genre
  that we are, or have they found a show that can imagine the end of capitalism as
  easily as it can imagine the end of the world? http://www.zero-books.net/books/capitalist-realism
