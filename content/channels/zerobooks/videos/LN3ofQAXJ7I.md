  Books: Marx Returns: http://www.zero-books.net/books/marx-... Zero Books Manifesto:
  The modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens
  and weâ€™re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and
  harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet
  has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation and atomization.
  Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend.'
