description: This weekâ€™s episode of the Zero Books podcast features a conversation
  with Professor Pete Bohmer from Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington.
  Evergreen has been in the news lately as students have protested professor Brett
  Weinstein over an email he sent to a private faculty list. In the email Weinstein
  objected to the students reversing what is traditionally called a Day of Absence
  wherein people of color leave campus voluntarily to demonstrate their importance
  to campus life. This year a call went out asking white people to leave. Brett Weinstein
  felt that this call abandoned a core principle of racial equality, namely that people
  should not be barred from participation in campus life based on the color of their
  skin.
