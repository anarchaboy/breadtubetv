description: 'Thaddeus Russell is a historian, author, and professor. He has taught
  history, American Studies, and the history of philosophy at Columbia University,
  Barnard College, and the New School for Social Research. He is also the host of
  the Unregistered Podcast and the guest on this week’s podcast. While we start off
  discussing the anti-SJW industry and Russell’s own encounters with it, we quickly
  veer off into a conversation about Capitalism, Foucault, whether rationalism is
  necessarily imperialist, Sam Harris, Noam Chomsky and a variety of other topics.
  Here''s a link to the second half of the conversation: https://youtu.be/3I2fQUOc9Ac'
