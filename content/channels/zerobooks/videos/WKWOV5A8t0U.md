  http://bit.ly/SubZeroBooks This video essay is a response to and partial refutation
  of Paul Joseph Watson’s video “The Truth About Modern Art.” In it we explore works
  by Duchamp, Joseph Kosuth, Nam June Paik, Bruce Nauman, Jeff Koons, and many others.
  We also readdress the question, “What music will help us get to a revolution?” #avantgarde

  Zero Books Manifesto: The modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across
  our smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical
  thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle
  and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation
  and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend.'
