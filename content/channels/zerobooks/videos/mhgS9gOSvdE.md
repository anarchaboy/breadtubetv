description: 'This video covers the facts around our recent run-in with youtube’s
  censorious algorithm, presents an excerpt from the upcoming Zero Books title “Other
  People’s Politics,” reconsiders Chomsky and Herman’s Propaganda Model, and describes
  some of the ideas of the liberal political commentator Walter Lippman, as we try
  to figure out a way forward in this highly controlled and censored moment. Books

  at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited
  to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend.'
