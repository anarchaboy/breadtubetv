  Walter Benn Michaels is a well known literary theorist and the author of political
  books such as The Trouble with Diversity: How We Learned to Love Identity and essays
  like The Beauty of a Social Problem. He is a controversial guest and one I was glad
  to talk to especially in the context of the reaction to my video critiquing intersectionality.

  is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited
  to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend.'
