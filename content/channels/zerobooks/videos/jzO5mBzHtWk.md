description: Join us for a discussion of the fifth chapter of Capital, Volume 1. "The
  form which circulation takes when money becomes capital, is opposed to all the laws
  we have hitherto investigated bearing on the nature of commodities, value and money,
  and even of circulation itself. What distinguishes this form from that of the simple
  circulation of commodities, is the inverted order of succession of the two antithetical
  processes, sale and purchase. How can this purely formal distinction between these
  processes change their character as it were by magic?"
