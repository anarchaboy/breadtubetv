description: 'In this video, Douglas Lain mansplains to MK Hobson about what the future
  of the abortion debate will look like and quotes an excerpt from Victoria Margree’s
  book “Neglected or Misunderstood: The Radical Feminism of Shulamith Firestone” in
  order to prove his point. Addendum: This video omitted the fact that transmen also
  have to struggle for their reproductive rights. That was an oversight and we''re
  adding this addendum in order to correct the mistake. Zero Books Logo Animations

  Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow
  or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting
  us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing
  process of alienation and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend.'
