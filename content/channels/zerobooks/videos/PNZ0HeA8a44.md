description: "Brendan O’Neill and Fredrick DeBoer are the guests this week as we dedicate
  this week’s episode to the question of punching Nazis.  Brendan O’Neill is the
  editor of Spiked Online, a publication that I would describe as having an attitude
  that is both socialist and libertarian in the American sense of the word. They advocate
  both expanding the range of human freedom and capitalist economic growth, despite
  being smart enough to know why capitalist economic growth can only occur when the
  mass of humanity is fettered.  Frederik DeBoer is a writer for publications such
  as Jacobin, the Observer, The Washington Post, Foreign Policy and other publications.
  He is a professor at Brooklyn College and describes himself as having conventionally
  leftist views. A socialist he is something of a mixer and has engaged in many twitter
  battles with (neo)liberals like Jonathan Chait and Sady Doyle.  This episode is
  something of a mash-up. It is the result of cutting down two interviews into a single
  polyphonous episode. Two otherwise disparate voices have been brought together here,
  not because they agree, but because they both have opinions and were willing to
  share them.  To underline the point further, let me say again, there are two people
  in this episode and two different opinions. DeBoer is the man with the American
  accent, O’Neill is the Brit.  Link to the Zero Squared podcast http://zero-books.net/blogs/zero/category/zero-squared/
