type: video
description: "This episode of the Zero Books podcast is a conversation with the Lindsay
  Shepherd. Shepherd hit the Zeitgeist recently when she was reprimanded for showing
  her class an excerpt from a debate on gender pronouns that originally aired on the
  television program the Agenda. The program featured professor Jordan Peterson, who
  is scheduled to be a guest on this podcast next month, and Shepherd was told that
  by showing the clip from the program she'd committed an act of violence against
  transgendered students either in her class or on campus.  We’ve moved the Inside
  Zero Books podcast from the Zero Books blog to Patreon. This will make it easier
  to get the member’s only podcast on podcatchers. It also means that we’ll be repeating
  the first year of Inside Zero Books daily on our Patreon account. If you missed
  Inside Zero Books podcast the first time, or if you just want to hear the old episodes
  again, they’ll be available.  If you haven’t already you might pick up Anselm
  Jappe’s The Writing on the Wall or Stuart Walton’s Neglected or Misunderstood: Introducing
  Theodor Adorno. Reading Angela Nagle's Kill All Normies would also be a great way
  to bring in the New Year.  - video upload powered by https://www.TunesToTube.com"
