  Chapter One, Section Four. It is not meant to be a substitute for actually reading
  Marx’s big book, but rather it is meant to entice you to read along with our Herding
  Cats reading group. Discussions between members of the reading group will be appearing
  monthly on this channel for as long as it takes us to get through Capital, Volume
  1. Read Capital, Volume One for free at marxists.org. https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/

  Zero Books Manifesto: The modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across
  our smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical
  thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle
  and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation
  and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend.'
