description: "Daniel Coffeen is the author of the Zero Books title \"Reading the Way
  of Things\" and a frequent guest on this podcast and many others including the Partially
  Examined Life.   In this episode we discuss his essay: \"On the Radical Empiricism
  of Rhetoric.\"   Here's an excerpt:  \"A rhetorical reckoning riles many
  people up as it doesn't try to ground itself or its going in anything outside itself
  — in a truth or axiom or universal claim. It is indifferent to such things except
  in as much as such things are arguments, things to reckon. And so rather than ever
  being tethered or even seeking a tether, the rhetorician begins to enjoy all the
  different ways different things can go. It reads multiple ways to reckon a puppy
  or ballet or chair. Rather than stake a single claim, she — our rhetorician — takes
  delight in the going of things, in the possible ways of things. Which can be infuriating
  to someone who's adamant in a single belief. This is what ballet is!\"  - video
