description: 'Support Zero Books on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/zerobooks How
  Slavoj Zizek provoked Jordan Peterson: Zizek''s essay for the Independent "Why do
  people find Jordan Peterson so convincing?" provoked a defensive reaction from both
  Peterson and his fans. This video will explore just why Žižek wrote the essay the
  way he did and how Žižek''s assessment that Peterson''s hot takes on subjects like
  white privilege and neo-Marxists ought to be slotted next the pseudo-observations
  of clowns like Milo Yiannopoulos. Subscribe: http://bit.ly/SubZeroBooks Watch the

  Zero Books Manifesto: The modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across
  our smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical
  thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle
  and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation
  and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend.'
