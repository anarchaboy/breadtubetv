description: "Chris Cutrone is the founder and President of the Platypus Affiliated
  Society. He is also the author of the rather infamous essay “Why Not Trump?” and
  other essays such as The Millennial Left is dead and Democratic revolution and the
  contradiction of capital. In this episode of the Zero Books podcast we discuss the
  Trump administration’s first year and the left’s various panicked reactions to what
  Cutrone says is a moment of transition for capitalism itself and US politics in
  particular.  - video upload powered by https://www.TunesToTube.com"
