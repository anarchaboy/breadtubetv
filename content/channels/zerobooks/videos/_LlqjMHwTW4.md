description: A reading of an excerpt from David Cromwell's book "Why Are We the Good
  Guys?" "Cromwell excels in unpicking the multiple deceits driving Western foreign
  policies, the ideological veil that keep us from ever seriously questioning the
  'benign intentions' of 'our' leaders' or a media which regards itself as an associate
  'good guy'." - John Hilley, Zen Politics http://www.zero-books.net/books/why-are-we-the-good-guys
