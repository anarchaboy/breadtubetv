  http://bit.ly/SubZeroBooks This video explores how an uncanny nostalgia defines
  the musical genre known as vaporwave and defines the Netflix series Stranger Things.
  Does this cultural repetition compulsion signal some sort of rupture or radical
  break? Book featured in this video: Babbling Corpse by Grafton Tanner http://www.zero-books.net/books/babbling-corpse

  Zero Books Manifesto: The modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across
  our smartphone screens and weâ€™re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical
  thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle
  and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation
  and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend.'
