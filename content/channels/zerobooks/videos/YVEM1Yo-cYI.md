description: 'Ben Burgis recounts his twitter encounter with the reactionary race
  realist youtuber and “logic” bros Stefan Molyneux. It turns out that Molyneux doesn’t
  know the difference between a sound and a valid argument, but he’s also unwilling
  to be corrected. Molyneux’s blocking Burgis on twitter and his subsequent subtweeting
  was “not an argument.” Zero Books Logo Animations and other animations donated by

  at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited
  to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend.'
