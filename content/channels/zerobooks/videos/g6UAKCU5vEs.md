title: 'Frozen Capitalism: Haunted by Vaporwave'

type: video
description: Did the 80s ever happen or is vaporwave the ghost of a past that never
  was? Are we doomed to mash up, distort and repeat, or has the crystallized moment
  called Neoliberalism shattered? This video reexamines Grafton Tanner's theories
  on Vaporwave, reassesses Mark Fisher's Capitalist Realism, and considers the possibility
  that history has reasserted itself in the worst of ways. http://www.zero-books.net/books/babbling-corpse
