description: 'This video series presents a careful reading of Slavoj Zizek’s “The
  Sublime Object of Ideology” while turning to various video games to provide clarifications
  of key concepts. In this third installment Marx’s notion of the Commodity fetish
  is compared to Freud’s approach to interpreting dreams. Relevant Books Zizek in

  Books Manifesto: The modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our
  smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking
  is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle and debate,
  the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation and
  atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend.'
