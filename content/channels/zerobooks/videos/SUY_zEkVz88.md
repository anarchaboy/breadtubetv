  http://bit.ly/SubZeroBooks This is the second video in a series of two videos on
  the topic of the Intellectual Dark Web. How and why are these free speech warriors
  misunderstanding Marx and how is it that Capitalist Realism is contributing to the
  rise of the right and the weakness of the left. Check out Brendan Cooney''s youtube
  channel on Marxism. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3F695D99C91FC6F7 Watch

  Books Manifesto: The modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our
  smartphone screens and weâ€™re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking
  is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle and debate,
  the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation and
  atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend.'
