title: Michel Houellebecq and The Liar's Paradox
date: "2019-10-11T16:22:54+08:00"
type: video
description: This video is about the impossibility of nihilism, the phony honesty
  of Michel Houellebecq, and how to find the meaning of life. Jumping off from Ben
  Jeffrey's book Anti-Matter we poke holes in the concept of ‘Depressive Realism’
  and then fill those holes in again. Merry Christmas! http://www.zero-books.net/books/anti-matter
