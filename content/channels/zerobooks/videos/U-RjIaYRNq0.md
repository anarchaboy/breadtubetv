description: 'Jordan Peterson and Slavoj Žižek have finally set a date and time to
  debate. The event is entitled “Happiness: Capitalism vs. Marxism” and will take
  place in Toronto’s Sony Center. This video aims to serve as a conceptual guide to
  the debate. How do Peterson and Žižek agree and disagree about happiness, capitalism,
  Marxism, and Christianity? This video will feature an excerpt from Ron Roberts book
  “Psychology and Capitalism” as we explore the differences between these two intellectuals.

  at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited
  to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend.'
