title: Ben Shapiro Fans Censor Us! (Or Why We Should Nationalize Google)

type: video
description: 'Ben Burgis’ last video was reported for violating community standards,
  blocked from suggested videos, and put behind a warning screen. We hold that that
  there was nothing offensive, nothing that violated community standards, in the video.
  This is Burgis’ response to the incident and his call for the nationalization of
  Google, Facebook, Twitter, and the rest. Zero Books Logo Animations and other animations

  Zero Books Manifesto: The modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across
  our smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical
  thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle
  and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation
  and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend.'
