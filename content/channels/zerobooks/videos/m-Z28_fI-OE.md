  the American tradition is a radical one. By comparing Thomas Paine to Edmund Burke
  he demonstrates how the American project was founded as a project of emancipation.

  at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited
  to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend.'
