description: 'Victoria Brooks F*%king Law is an urgent call for everyone, not just
  academics and researchers, to find inventive ways to question the ethics of sexuality
  and to question ethics through sexuality. McManus and Hamilton''s What is Postmodern
  Conservatism asks how we got from the so-called end of history to apocalyptic declarations
  of the end of western civilization. Both books are addressing Postmodernism only
  in different ways. Related Books: Fucking Law by Victoria Brooks What is Post-Modern
