description: "Symptomatic Redness is a show about political economics and historical
  analysis. Hosted by C. Derick Varn and Amogh Sahu the show is sometimes a dialogue
  between the hosts and sometimes features interviews with activists and academics.
   This month's Symptomatic Redness features a conversation about Marx and Marxism's
  relationship with religion. The podcast circles around the questions  Does Marxism
  have a coherent ethics? Does Marxism have a theory of consciousness? And to
  what extent is Marx or Marxism guilty of idealism?  - video upload powered by
