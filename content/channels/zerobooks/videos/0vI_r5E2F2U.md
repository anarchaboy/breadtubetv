  http://bit.ly/SubZeroBooks  Virgil Texas and Matt Christman are two of the five
  co-hosts from the hugely popular leftist podcast Chapo Trap House and they stopped
  by the Zero Books podcast this week to discuss their new book The Chapo Guide to
  Revolution: A Manifesto Against Logic, Facts and Reason.   Like Chapo, Zero
  Books has a Patreon. Unlike Chapo we don’t have tens of thousands of patreon supporters.
  We do have over four hundred supporters, however, and we are producing a second
  podcast for this select group every week. We’ve also started a Zero Books book club
  and supporters on Patreon can participate in an online discussion group about a
  select Zero Books title every month. If you enjoy the podcast or just want to support
  the imprint you might consider supporting us on Patreon.   Music and clips featured

  is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited
  to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization.   Zer0 Books wants to
  work against this trend."
