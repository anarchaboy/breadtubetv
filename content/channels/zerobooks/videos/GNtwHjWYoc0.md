description: 'This is the second of two videos on the topic of call-out culture, SJWs,
  and the left. In part one we critiqued Slavoj Zizek’s essay “Toxic Masculinity.”
  In this video we examine Mark Fisher’s “Exiting the Vampire Castle” and Angela Nagle’s
  “Kill All Normies” in a Capitalist Realist context. Can there be an Anti-SJW Left?

  Zero Books Manifesto: The modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across
  our smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical
  thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle
  and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation
  and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend.'
