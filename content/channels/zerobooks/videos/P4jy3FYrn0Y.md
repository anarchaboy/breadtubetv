description: 'This is a continuation of our series on rethinking Critical Theory.
  In this video, we consider Russell Jacoby’s essay “The Declining Rate of Intelligence”
  in order to think through how capitalism’s development limits our ability to cope
  and think. This video takes excerpts from “What is Postmodern Conservatism?”, “Give
  Them an Argument: Logic for the Left?”, and Neglected or Misunderstood: Introducing
  Theodor Adorno. Jacoby''s Essay: The Declining Rate of Intelligence https://damagemag.com/2019/07/29/a-falling-rate-of-intelligence/

  Zero Books Manifesto: The modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across
  our smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical
  thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle
  and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation
  and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend.'
