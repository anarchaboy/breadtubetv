  http://bit.ly/SubZeroBooks Comparing Bojack Horseman to the NBC philosophical comedy
  The Good Place, this video critiques Postmodernism and Deconstruction while trying
  to answer Max Horkheimer’s objection to Enlightenment Reason and find a philosophical
  foundation for a new universalism. Excerpts from Mark Fisher’s books Capitalist
  Realism and Ghosts of My Life set the terms for this one. Zero Books Logo Animations

  is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited
  to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend.'
