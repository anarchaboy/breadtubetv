title: The Meaning of "Law and Order" and the Limits of Antifa
date: "2019-10-11T16:22:51+08:00"
type: video
description: 'This video explains the political character of calls for “law and order,”
  criticizes the apparent naivete (and perhaps inadvertent reactionary politics) of
  Bret Weinstein, examines political violence, and critiques Antifa. The video also
  includes excerpts from David Blacker’s “What’s Left of the World,” and Carl Freedman’s
  “The Age of Nixon” and attempts to reframe questions of authority, policing, and
  law and order with a Situationist and Marxist analysis. Zero Books Logo Animations

  at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited
  to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend.'
