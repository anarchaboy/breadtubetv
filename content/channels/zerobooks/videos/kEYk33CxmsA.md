type: video
description: 'The history of really existing socialist parties in Europe has been
  the history of social democracy. In this video the differences between social democratic,
  Bolshevik, and Marxist understandings of Marx are highlighted. We also consider
  how Anselm Jappe’s “The Writing on the Wall” suggests anti-politics as a solution
  for the impasse between socialism and social democracy. Zero Books Logo Animations

  at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited
  to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend.'
