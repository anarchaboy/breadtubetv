description: "Jefferson Cowie is the guest on this podcast from 2011. Cowie is the
  author of the book Stayin' Alive: The 1970s and the Last Days of the Working Class
  and this interview is being rereleased now as, under Trump, Cowie's insights seem
  helpful.  From the Book Jacket: An epic account of how middle-class America
  hit the rocks in the political and economic upheavals of the 1970s, this wide-ranging
  cultural and political history rewrites the 1970s as the crucial, pivotal era of
  our time. Jefferson CowieÃ¢€™s edgy and incisive bookâ€”part political intrigue,
  part labor history, with large doses of American musical, film, and TV loreâ€”makes
  new sense of the 1970s as a crucial and poorly understood transition from New Deal
  America (with its large, optimistic middle class) to the widening economic inequalities,
  poverty, and dampened expectations of the 1980s and into the present."
