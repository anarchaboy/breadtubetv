  is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and weâ€™re invited
  to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization.   Zer0 Books wants to
  work against this trend."
