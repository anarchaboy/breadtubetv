  Year’s Eve we’ll rewind in order to examine the temporal character of capitalism.
  While taking excerpts from Capitalist Realism and Ghosts of My Life, this video
  is mostly an exploration of Moishe Postone’s “Time, Labor and Social Domination.”

  https://www.patreon.com/zerobooks Zero Books Manifesto: The modern world is at an
  impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited to like,
  follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than
  connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend.'
