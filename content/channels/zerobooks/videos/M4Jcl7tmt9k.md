description: Nikos Sotirakopoulos and Ashley Frawley join Doug in this special, mostly
  unedited, episode of the Zero Squared podcast. This was recorded on the fly as a
  way to have a quick conversation about the Zizek vs. Peterson debate and, as a way
  to continue the debate. Nikos is a committed Randian while Ashley Frawley and Doug
  are both Marxists. Hope you enjoy this conversation/debate. It is being released
  for everyone.
