description: 'Ben Burgis returns to discuss logic, Ad Hominem fallacies, inconsistent
  arguments and why libertarians are being inconsistent when they support so-called
  “right to work” legislation in the United States. Also featured in this video is
  a clip from a recent Chapo Trap House live event at Princeton wherein the Chapo
  gang suggested that “logical fallacies are just something nerds invented so they
  can say ‘time out’ in the middle of an ass-kicking.” Sign up to win a free copy

  Zero Books Manifesto: The modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across
  our smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical
  thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle
  and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation
  and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend.'
