  http://bit.ly/SubZeroBooks This is part one of a two part series of videos that
  will return to some of the ideas that were in our recent video on postmodernism,
  only this time we’ll step back from the 70s and into the 19th and the first half
  of the 20th century to do so. These videos will ask the philosophical questions
  “what is it to be human” or “what is it to be a self or a subject” only instead
  of arguing with Derrida while referring to Bojack Horseman and The Good Place, we’ll
  take on Max Stirner and Martin Heidegger while referencing Nicholas Ray’s 1955 film
  Rebel Without a Cause and video games. Watch Part Two: Video Games and Heidegger

  is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited
  to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend.'
