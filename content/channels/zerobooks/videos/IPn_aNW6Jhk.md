  http://bit.ly/SubZeroBooks  The Zero Squared podcast is returning to our youtube
  channel. This week Chris Cutrone, who is a member of the Platypus Affiliated Society
  and a professor at The School of Art Institute of Chicago is a returning guest.
  He is the author of a controversial essay entitled “Why Not Trump.” The piece was
  a half-hearted endorsement of Trump as the better adversary for the left, an opinion
  that is not at all self-evident today under Trump. However, this week we discuss
  the left theorists Moishe Postone and Adolph Reed in the context of the death of
  politics.  Support us on Patreon and get access to the Herding Cats: Capital

   Zero Books Manifesto:  The modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll
  across our smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical
  thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle
  and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation
  and atomization.   Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend."
