  out from Zero Books, but from Oxford University Press. The Elephant in Your Brain
  argues, among other things, that all human conversations are about virtue signalling.
  Mark Fisher’s Capitalist Realism is brought to bear on this question of virtue signalling
  online and in general, the problem of unconscious motivation for revolutionaries,
  and the need to get beyond immediate self-interest. Capitalist Realism by Mark Fisher

  Zero Books Manifesto: The modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across
  our smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical
  thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle
  and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation
  and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend.'
