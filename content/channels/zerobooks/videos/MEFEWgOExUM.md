  http://bit.ly/SubZeroBooks Ben Burgis, author of Give Them An Argument:Logic for
  the Left, addresses the question “Is socialism against human nature?” in this video.
  Burgis believes that the left would do well to take on bad arguments and that the
  rules of logic favor the left. Zero Books Logo Animations and other animations donated

  impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited to like,
  follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than
  connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend.'
