  http://bit.ly/SubZeroBooks This video attempts to answer the question “What is Fascism
  and how to be beat it?” by referring to Angela Nagle’s 2017 essay “Goodbye, Pepe,”
  and Gilles Dauve. Are the Proud Boys where the fascist movement has rebranded itself
  after Charlottesville? If so, what do we do about it? Book Mentioned Kill All Normies

  Zero Books Manifesto: The modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across
  our smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical
  thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle
  and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation
  and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend.'
