type: video
description: 'A lot of critical theory approaches the media as a form of propaganda
  or brainwashing. In this first episode of WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY author MK Hobson
  (Native Star-https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003F3PKFY) and Zero Books publisher and
  author Douglas Lain (Bash Bash Revolution-https://www.amazon.com/Bash-Revolution-Douglas-Lain-ebook/dp/B07H472CHB)
  question this view as they explore and explain the topic “Ideology and Media.” WE
  LIVE IN A SOCIETY is a new monthly video series modeled on educational television
  programs like 3...2...1 Contact and Square One Television, only rather than explaining
  the natural sciences, WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY aims to explore Critical Theory of the
  Marxist variety. In this episode the Zero Books titles Neglected or Misunderstood:
  Introducing Theodor Adorno, Give Them an Argument, and the Coming Revolution are
  cited. Zero Books Logo Animations and other animations donated by Brian Cole https://www.instagram.com/robotbloodco/

  at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited
  to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend.'
