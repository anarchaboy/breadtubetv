type: video
description: 'Many on the right are worried that there is a war on Christmas. Many
  on the left aren’t sure but suspect that there SHOULD be a war on Christmas and
  on Christianity. The history of really existing socialism includes a history of
  state-support for atheism. Should the left throw their eggnog in the trash and burn
  the mistletoe? Zero Books Logo Animations and other animations donated by Brian

  is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited
  to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend.'
