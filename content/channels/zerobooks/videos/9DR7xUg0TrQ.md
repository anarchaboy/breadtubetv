description: In this youtube video we’re going to take a look at Nina Power’s 2009
  feminist Tract “One Dimensional Woman” and find out how the book is holding up seven
  years later. Was Power right when she suggested that feminists should be perhaps
  a bit less concerned about representation and more concerned about structural problems
  in this digital spectacle that we take to be the modern world? http://www.zero-books.net/books/one-dimensional-woman
