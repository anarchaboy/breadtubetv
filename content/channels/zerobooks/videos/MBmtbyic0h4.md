description: 'Slavoj Žižek is perhaps the world’s most famous philosopher. However,
  the arguments of the “Elvis of Critical Theory” are sometimes difficult to fully
  grasp, but we''ll follow his example and use pop cultural reference in an attempt
  to make the ideas more accessible. This video series will take on the ideas in Žižek’s
  first book: The Sublime Object of Ideology in an effort to explicate and evaluate
  them. Find out if Žižek’s is a philosophy without milk or without cream and ENJOY
  eating from the trashcan. Related Books Ideology and the Virtual City: Videogames,

  Books Manifesto: The modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our
  smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking
  is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle and debate,
  the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation and
  atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend.'
