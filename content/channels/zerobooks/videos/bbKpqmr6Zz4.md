description: "Josie Appleton is the author of the book Officious: the Rise of the
  Busybody State which came out from Zero Books in 2016 and in this episode of the
  podcast she discusses her controversial blog post entitled #Metoo: The criminalization
  of sexual passion.  I want to remind you that we’ve moved the Inside Zero Books
  podcast from the Zero Books blog to Patreon. This will make it easier to get the
  member’s only podcast on podcatchers. It also means that we’ll be repeating the
  first year of Inside Zero Books daily on our Patreon account. If you missed Inside
  Zero Books podcast the first time, or if you just want to hear the old episodes
  again, they’ll be available.  If you haven’t already you might pick up Anselm
  Jappe’s The Writing on the Wall or Stuart Walton’s Neglected or Misunderstood: Introducing
  Theodor Adorno. Also, a perfect Christmas gift for the leftist in your life might
  be Kill All Normies by Angela Nagle.  - video upload powered by https://www.TunesToTube.com"
