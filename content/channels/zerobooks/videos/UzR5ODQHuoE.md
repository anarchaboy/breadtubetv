type: video
description: 'Steven Shaviro’s Post-Cinematic Affect is about what it feels like to
  live in the affluent West in the early 21st century, specifically, it explores the
  structure of feeling that is emerging today in tandem with new digital technologies.
  In this video, we consider Shaviro’s book as it relates to Spinoza’s philosophy
  of Affect and in relation to the films of Stan Brakhage. Zero Books Logo Animations

  at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited
  to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend.'
