description: 'This is a slightly corrected rerun of a video about how Jordan Peterson
  and Slavoj Žižek have finally set a date and time to debate. The event is entitled
  “Happiness: Capitalism vs. Marxism” and will take place in Toronto’s Sony Center.
  This video aims to serve as a conceptual guide to the debate. How do Peterson and
  Žižek agree and disagree about happiness, capitalism, Marxism, and Christianity?
  This video will feature an excerpt from Ron Roberts book “Psychology and Capitalism”
  as we explore the differences between these two intellectuals. . Zero Books Logo

  Zero Books Manifesto: The modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across
  our smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical
  thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle
  and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation
  and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend.'
