  shows a passenger on a United Airlines flight from Chicago to Louisville being forcibly
  removed from the plane before takeoff at Oâ€™Hare International Airport. [...] "Flight
  3411 from Chicago to Louisville was overbooked," the spokesperson said. "After our
  team looked for volunteers, one customer refused to leave the aircraft voluntarily
  and law enforcement was asked to come to the gate." http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/2017/04/10/video-shows-man-forcibly-removed-united-flight-chicago-louisville/100274374/'
