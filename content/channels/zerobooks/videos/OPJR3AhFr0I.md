description: Zero Books Manifesto The modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll
  across our smartphone screens and weâ€™re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical
  thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle
  and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation
  and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend. With critical theory
  as our jumping off point, we aim to publish books, record podcasts, and create videos
  that make our readers, listeners, and viewers uncomfortable. We want to beyond hot
  takes and received opinions. Zer0 Books is on the left and wants to reinvent the
  left. We are sick of the injustice, the suffering, and the stupidity that defines
  both our political and cultural world, and we aim to find a new foundation for a
  new struggle.
