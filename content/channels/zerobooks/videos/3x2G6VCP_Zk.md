description: The world is increasingly unthinkable, a world of planetary disasters,
  emerging pandemics, and the looming threat of extinction. In this book Eugene Thacker
  suggests that we look to the genre of horror as offering a way of thinking about
  the unthinkable world. To confront this idea is to confront the limit of our ability
  to understand the world in which we live â€“ a central motif of the horror genre.
