description: "Chris Knight is currently senior research fellow in the department of
  anthropology at University College, London, focusing his research on the evolutionary
  emergence of human language and symbolic culture. He lives in London. His book Decoding
  Chomsky came out from Yale University Press in 2016 and was recently released in
  paperback. Since the book first dropped Chomsky has read it and has responded.
  Chomsky wrote:   Knight makes an assumption common to those who [are] unfamiliar
  with government science-technology policy and know nothing about institutions like
  MIT...The whole story is a wreck."
