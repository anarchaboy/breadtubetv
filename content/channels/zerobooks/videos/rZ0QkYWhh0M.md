  with the rest of Facebook) has tranformed into a lifeless robot, why what is good
  for Facebook is bad for humanity, and take a quote from the Zero Books title "Dead
  Man Working." Watch the most popular Zero Books episodes: http://bit.ly/2KbC2hF

  Zero Books Manifesto: The modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across
  our smartphone screens and weâ€™re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical
  thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle
  and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation
  and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend.'
