  Immigration: It''s About Power we take excerpts from Agata Pyzik’s “Poor But Sexy”
  and Yasin Kakande’s “Slave States” in order to explore the true impact of undocumented
  workers on the economy and on wages, and in order to explore what the consequence
  of offering a path towards citizenship might really be for both the native working
  class and for the working class as a whole. Zero Books Logo Animations and other
  animations donated by Brian Cole https://www.instagram.com/robotbloodco/ Music and

  Zero Books Manifesto: The modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across
  our smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical
  thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle
  and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation
  and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend.'
