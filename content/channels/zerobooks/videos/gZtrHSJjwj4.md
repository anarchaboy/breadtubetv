  Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and weâ€™re invited to like, follow
  or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting
  us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing
  process of alienation and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend.'
