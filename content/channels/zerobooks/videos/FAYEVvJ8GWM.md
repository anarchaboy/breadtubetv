  and the Moments that Made Us which is out now from Zero books.  I want to thank
  Adam A, Thomas G, the Frankfurt Shul, Leo, Anton S, Eric G, Kyle E, and the 236
  other Patrons of the Inside Zero Books podcast. You are making Zero Books’ digital
  content production possible.  I also want to remind listeners that if you enjoy
  this podcast you might want to become patron as well. Patrons will hear the second
  half of this conversation with Shaun Scott as well as gain access to episodes on
  topics such as Bordiga, Struggle Sessions, a long lost conversation with Angela
  Nagle, as well as the second half of this conversation with Shaun Scott.  If
  you haven’t already you might pick up a copy of Marx Returns by Jason Barker, get
  ahold of Angela Nagle’s Kill All Normies, or check out Mark Fisher’s Capitalist
  Realism."
