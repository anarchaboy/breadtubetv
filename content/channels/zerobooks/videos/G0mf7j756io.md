title: Capitalism vs. Life on Earth
date: "2019-10-11T16:22:59+08:00"
type: video
description: 'Nobody can deny that we’re facing an environmental crisis. Animal species
  are dying off at an alarming rate, the oceans are dying, and the climate is changing.
  Even worse, our way of understanding and trying to address this crisis is captured
  within the very system that’s generating the crisis. This video takes excerpts from
  Leigh Phillips “Austerity Ecology,” and Frithjof Bergmann’s “New Work/New Culture”
  in an effort to find an exit from the kind of thinking that makes change seem impossible.
  This video was made in collaboration with Art House Politics: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnuC9wCnogZA8VcTQJ1_5wg

  Zero Books Manifesto: The modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across
  our smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical
  thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle
  and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation
  and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend.'
