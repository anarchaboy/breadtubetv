  http://bit.ly/SubZeroBooks A rather playful and utopian vision of socialism that
  defends video games and gamers from over eager critics of capitalism who have too
  quickly decided that Pac Man, Mario, and other pixelated heroes are on the side
  of reaction. Watch the most popular Zero Books episodes: http://bit.ly/2KbC2hF Facebook:

  Zero Books Manifesto: The modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across
  our smartphone screens and weâ€™re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical
  thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle
  and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation
  and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend.'
