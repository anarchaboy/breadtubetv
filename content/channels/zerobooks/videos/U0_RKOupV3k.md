  author of the upcoming book “Give Them an Argument: Logic For the Left.” Ben returns
  to answer the question “Did Karl Marx Kill Millions?” In this video Burgis’ calls
  out Peterson and Shapiro for the hypocrisy as they champion free speech and the
  need for open debate while avoiding any real engagement with their political enemies.

  is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited
  to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend.'
