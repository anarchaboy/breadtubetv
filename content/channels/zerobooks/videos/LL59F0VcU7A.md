  http://bit.ly/SubZeroBooks Author Ben Burgis explains how to handle right-wing thought
  experiments and engage in arguments rather than only relying on snark and ridicule
  to win the day. He takes on two thought experiments from conservatives in this video,
  one involving Brett Kavanaugh and the other involving medicare for all. Zero Books

  is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and weâ€™re invited
  to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend.'
