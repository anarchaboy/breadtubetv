title: How to Be an Artist when Nothing Lasts Forever
date: "2019-10-11T16:24:05+08:00"
type: video
description: 'This video is the third in a series about self-consciousness. This time
  rather than exclusively focusing on Bill Murray or the history of Dada and Surrealism
  (although they’ll both come up again)we start off opposing Slavoj Zizek’s version
  of Hegelian Materialism against Alan Watts’ Western Buddhism. We then take up an
  excerpt from Graham Harman’s book “Weird Realism,” and only THEN return to Bill
  Murray and Avant-Garde art as both appear in the unreleased cult film “Nothing Lasts
  Forever.” Zero Books Logo Animations and other animations donated by Brian Cole

  Books Manifesto: The modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our
  smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking
  is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle and debate,
  the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation and
  atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend.'
