  http://bit.ly/SubZeroBooks This video is an attempt to tackle the question “Is Life
  Worth Living?” However, it ends up answering a different question, namely, “What
  sort of cultural/psychological structures must be either held onto or created if
  life is going to be meaningful?” Excerpts from Eugene Thacker’s In The Dust of This
  Planet and Mark Fisher’s Capitalist Realism are featured. Thacker’s work is perhaps
  misread, but in what I hope is a creative and constructive way. There is an attempt
  to turn his pessimism inside out. Zero Books Logo Animations and other animations

  is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited
  to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend.'
