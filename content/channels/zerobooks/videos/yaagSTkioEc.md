description: "Vakhtang Gomelauri is a clinical social worker and therapist out of
  NYC, he is also a returning guest to the podcast and will be joining me at the Left
  Forum in June for a debate about Marx’s conception of surplus value and Lacan’s
  notion of the same.   Here’s the description of the panel:   There are many
  definitions of \"surplus value\" on the left, perhaps too many. This debate/panel
  discussion will take a look at two approaches to the surplus created under capitalism.
  One version of surplus value comes to us from Marx and his law of value, while the
  other emerged from Jacques Lacan's return to Freud. What is the relationship between
  Lacan and his followers psychoanalytic reinterpretation of Marx and Marx's original
  theory? Can one hold with both Marx and Lacan?  This podcast is going out to
  both Patreon members and on youtube. Enjoy."
