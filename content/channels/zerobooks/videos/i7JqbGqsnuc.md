description: "C Derick Varn is on the podcast again, this time to discuss Lukacs’
  1920 essay Class Consciousness. This conversation goes into the weeds on philosophical
  and economic categories and tries to both “Straw Man” and “Steel Man” Lukacs’ essay
  in an effort to point out what we take to be common or at least possible misreadings
  as well as what we take to be the best and most coherent readings of the essay.
