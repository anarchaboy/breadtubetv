description: Slavoj Žižek is the guest on this Zero Books podcast. We discuss the
  flak he’s received for a few of his Lacanian interventions into politics recently,
  Marx’s Labor Theory of Value, and his most current book Against the Double Blackmail.
  “[A]n urgent and entertaining diagnosis of the ongoing refugee crisis and global
  terror threat, highlighting the glaring contradictions in our attitudes and actions.”
  —Mother Jones “Slavoj Žižek’s compellingly persuasive insights into the current
  refugee explosion…could not arrive at a more urgent time.”—CounterPunch Thanks goes
