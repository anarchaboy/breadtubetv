  In this video, we compare The Razor’s Edge to The Surrealist Manifesto. We take
  up an excerpt from Mikkel Bolt Rassmussen’s book After the Great Refusal as we ask
  the question, “Do we have to become enlightened before we can have our revolution?”

  at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited
  to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend.'
