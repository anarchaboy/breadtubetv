type: video
description: This second video on Jordan Peterson makes a simple distinction between
  left and right by referring to Leigh Phillips book Austerity Ecology and the Collapse
  Porn Addicts, we argue that the abandonment of progress and the power of human reason
  in favor of a return to mysticism and myth defines Peterson's project. Dan Harmon,
  Rick Roderick, and Jung are included in this mash-up http://www.zero-books.net/books/austerity-ecology-collapse-porn-addicts
