description: "Terry Tapp is the artist and author behind the Lungfish project. \"The
  Lungfish Project\" is a three-part graphic novel series and Kickstarter project
  bringing picto-philosophy to the masses. He is the Zero Books author of “A Serf’s
  Journal,” and a returning guest to this podcast.  Check out his project on Kickstarter:
  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1132611188/the-lungfish-project   This
  week’s podcast is available in full for everyone. Our Patreon supporters get access
  to two podcasts every week: Symptomatic Redness and Zero Squared, but if you’re
  listening on our free feed you’ll always be able to access one or the other podcasts
  each week. At the moment we have 594 patrons, but we did reach 600 patrons last
  month. Therefore, we’ll introduce the new series of patron only videos tentatively
  entitled Communism 101 by the end of May and I expect that we’ll be able to get
  over 600 again and continue on with the series in the months to come."
