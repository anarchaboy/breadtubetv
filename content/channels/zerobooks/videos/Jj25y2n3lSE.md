  http://bit.ly/SubZeroBooks  Mir Bal is the host of the A Lost Cause podcast
  out of Sweden, he is also a former social worker turned barista, an immigrant, and
  a socialist. He joins the Zero Books podcast in order to discuss immigration to
  the Swedish Utopia and why the Scandinavian Model really is a worker’s paradise...or
  maybe that’s not the conclusion we reached.   If you haven’t already supported
  us on Patreon you’re missing out on a second podcast every week and if you haven’t
  joined the Zero Books reading group then you’re missing out on a chance to discuss
  Adorno. We’re edging up towards 500 patrons so now is a good time to join in.

   Zero Books Manifesto:  The modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll
  across our smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical
  thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle
  and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation
  and atomization.   Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend."
