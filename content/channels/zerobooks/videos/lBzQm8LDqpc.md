description: 'DO YOU HAVE QUESTIONS FOR ELIOT? If so leave a comment below! Eliot
  Rosenstock is a therapist living in California who, for legal and theoretical reasons,
  will not be offering therapeutic advice on youtube. His new series "Ask Eliot" is
  an attempt to counter the Therapeutic Positivism given expression through conventional
  advice columns and self-help shows. The aim is to go beyond advice-giving to theory
  and emancipation, or if that proves impossible, then to provide a few laughs. Book
  Mentioned in this Video Zizek in the Clinic by Eliot Rosenstock https://www.amazon.com/Zizek-Clinic-Revolutionary-Proposal-Psychotherapy/dp/1785359258

  Zero Books Manifesto: The modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across
  our smartphone screens and weâ€™re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical
  thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle
  and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation
  and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend.'
