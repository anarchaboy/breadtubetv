description: A reading from Maurizio Ferraris' book "Positive Realism." "Ferraris
  showed great courage in the brutally anti-realist continental philosophy of the
  early 1990s. He argues rigorously, and is also an erudite and cultured person with
  an unusually good sense of humor." - Graham Harman http://www.zero-books.net/books/positive-realism
