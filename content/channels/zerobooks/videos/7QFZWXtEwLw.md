title: Jordan Peterson- engaging with conservative rebels

description: Too often the left fails to engage with conservative critics of modernity
  and this failure allows right-wing tropes and concepts to go unchallenged. For instance,
  if only the right will address the way social alienation creates a sense of meaninglessness
  and instability, then only the right will reach people who long for meaning and
  stability. Further, not answering the strongest arguments from our ideological opponents
  but merely denouncing them leaves us defenseless when our social authority wears
  out. This Zero Books podcast is dedicated to Mark Fisher. It is a response to the
  lectures and videos of University professor and anti-PC youtube star Jordan Peterson.
