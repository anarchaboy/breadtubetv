  video picks apart the right-wing Day for Freedom video, examines how the alt-lite
  uses the Streisand Effect to spread its message, and points out that Karl Marx was
  a champion of free speech. Addendum: At 3:21 Milo is talking about when he was 13
  and was abused by older men. He is saying that he was the predator even though he
  was 13. Subscribe: http://bit.ly/SubZeroBooks Watch the most popular Zero Books

  Manifesto: The modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone
  screens and weâ€™re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder
  and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the
  internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation and atomization.
  Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend.'
