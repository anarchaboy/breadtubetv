  http://bit.ly/SubZeroBooks This video is a call for submissions for a new line of
  books. Realizing Philosophy will take up what’s called the Western tradition with
  the aim not only of understanding the history of ideas but of realizing them. Inspired
  by Andrew Feenberg’s book “Realizing Philosophy” we are now aiming to create a series
  of introductory philosophy books written from a Marxist perspective. Contact us

  Zero Books Manifesto: The modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across
  our smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical
  thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle
  and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation
  and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend.'
