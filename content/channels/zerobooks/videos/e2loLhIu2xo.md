description: 'The question “What would happen if every worker in America won a million
  dollars?” sets up a rather absurd thought experiment, but it’s one that gets to
  the heart of what Marx and Engels really meant when they claimed that the material
  basis of society determined, in the last analysis, what happens in society. Zero

  at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited
  to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend.'
