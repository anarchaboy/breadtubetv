title: Evaluating the Žižek vs. Peterson Debate
date: "2019-09-15T10:39:57+08:00"
description: 'The debate between Slavoj Žižek and Jordan Peterson was billed as the
  “debate of the century,” but many on the American far left were unimpressed by the
  prospect of it. This video explores what the outcome of the debate might have been,
  critiques the criticism of the debate, and provides an excerpt from Eliot Rosenstock’s
  book “Zizek in the Clinic". [Addendum: At the 9 minute and 20-second mark I credit
  Harrison Fluss for writing a criticism of Zizek in Jacobin. I should have credited
  both Harrison Fluss and Sam Miller.] Zero Books Logo Animations and other animations

  at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited
  to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend.'
