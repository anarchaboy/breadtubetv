description: "Terry Tapp is a red worker from a red state. He’s also an artist and
  a writer. His book, \"A Serf’s Journal: The Story of the United States’ Longest
  Wildcat Strike\" is coming out from Zero Books in 2017.  Micah Uetricht of Jacobin
  Magazine blurbed the book this way:  Every day, millions of people grind their
  way through miserable work. And every day, a few of them decide the status quo cannot
  stand — they have to fight back. Very few of either of those stories ever get told,
  particularly by the heroic people who lived them. Terry Tapp does both in a tale
  of unbelievably miserable, dangerous work and courageous, fed-up workers up against
  incredibly tall odds. Anyone who has worked a terrible job should read it. Anyone
  who has dreamed about fighting back should study it.  -Video Upload powered
