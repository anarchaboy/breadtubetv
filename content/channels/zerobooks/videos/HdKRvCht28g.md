  replied to an open letter written by Brent Cooper promoting the upcoming conference
  “Responding to Peterson in lieu of a debate” with a rather pissy dismissal. Here’s
  a link to the tweet from Peterson that includes his letter (https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson/status/1044572865419497472)

  Zero Books Manifesto: The modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across
  our smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical
  thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle
  and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation
  and atomization. Zer0 Books wants to work against this trend.'
