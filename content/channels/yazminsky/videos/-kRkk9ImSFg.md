description: You could fit almost the entire history of videogames into the time span
  covered by the silent film era, yet we consider it a mature medium, rather than
  one just breaking out of its infancy. Like silent movies, classic games are often
  incomplete, damaged, or technically limited, but have a beauty all their own. In
  this spirit, indie game developer Joe Blair and I built Metropoloid, a remix of
  Fritz Lang's Metropolis which replaces its famously lost score with that of its
  contemporaries from the early days of games. twitter.com/Yaz_Minsky ko-fi.com/yazminsky
