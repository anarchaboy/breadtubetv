description: 'We need to talk about cyberpunk (the genre, not the game) (okay the
  game a little bit too). Cybperpunk 2077 has been criticized for its handling of
  issues related to trans representation and disability, and this criticism made me
  want to look back at the retro cyberpunk the game is inspired by. We can find that
  the genre has a lot of negative baggage and regressive worldviews in its roots,
  and that modern cyberpunk creators have moved past with or engaged with these ideas
  in ways that other works have failed to. https://twitter.com/Yaz_Minsky https://ko-fi.com/yazminsky
