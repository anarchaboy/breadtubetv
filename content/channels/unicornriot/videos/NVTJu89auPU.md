description: 'Unicorn Riot is LIVE from downtown St Paul Minnesota where a Puerto
  Rico solidarity march has been organized. Protests have been happening world-wide
  in solidarity with the Boricuan #RickyRenuncia movement, which saw social media
  set ablaze by Puerto Ricans enraged in the wake of leaked violently misogynistic
  group chats involving governor Ricardo Rosselló and other government officials,
  and demanding the resignation of the governor. https://unicornriot.ninja/2019/puerto-rico-boriken-solidarity-action-in-minnesota/
