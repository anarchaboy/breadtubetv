  and Randy Russell will be the first people in Denver to fight the city''s camping
  ban. The "survival ban," as Howard calls it, criminalizes anyone who is resting
  or sleeping in public space with anything underneath them or on top of them other
  than their clothing. The three defendants were given tickets for illegal camping
  on November 28, 2016. Here is the accompanying article: unicornriot.ninja/?p=14467
