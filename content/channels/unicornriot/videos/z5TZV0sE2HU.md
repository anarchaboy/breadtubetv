description: 'Riots erupted throughout Hamburg as the G20 Summit met. Police water
  cannons were fired into the crowd trying to disperse the protest. The militant autonomous
  & anti-capitalist protesters used rocks, fireworks and bottles to keep the police
  lines back as the cannons swept the crowd knocking many to ground. Police beat people
  to the ground and kicked those that had already fallen. Individuals that were not
  saved by fellow protesters were dragged away by police through inches of broken
  glass that covered the cobblestone roads. For more info: http://www.unicornriot.ninja/?p=16985
