  In 2019, Unicorn Riot interviewed three New Yorkers who volunteered to fight alongside
  the Peoples’ Protection Units (YPG) and Syrian Democratic Forces against ISIS and
  Turkey. The documentary features their oral accounts overlaid with contributed footage
  from anonymous sources to bring you a first person point of view of what happened
  to fighters as they held the front line in defense of Rojava, an autonomous zone
  in northern Syria. The three men share their perspectives of what they witnessed
  while playing a small role in the Syrian Civil War as international volunteers for
  the YPG. Viewer discretion advised: This film is not rated and contains strong language,
