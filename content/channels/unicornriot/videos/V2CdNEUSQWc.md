description: 'Tensions are high in Portland as a far-right rally, whose organizers
  have threatened violence, is opposed by large anti-racist counter-protests. A massive
  police presence has saturated the downtown rally area and city officials has told
  people to avoid the area. Unicorn Riot will be providing updates from on the ground
  throughout the day. Today''s rallies are the latest in a years-long series of rallies
  by xenophobic groups like Patriot Prayer and the Proud Boys traveling to Portland
  to seek out confrontation. In spring 2017, Jeremy Christian, a white supremacist
  and frequent attendee of Patriot Prayer rallies, stabbed 3 people and killing 2,
  on a Portland public transit following an anti-Muslim outburst. For more info: https://unicornriot.ninja/2019/tensions-high-as-far-right-rally-tied-to-threats-hits-portland/
