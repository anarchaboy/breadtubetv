description: 'On Friday, June 29, 2018, eight protesters were arrested after symbolically
  locking themselves in a set-up cage in front of General Dynamics in Bloomington,
  Minnesota. In a released statement by the arrestees, they stated their reasoning
  for targeting General Dynamics: "General Dynamics provides support services to the
  family separation and detention process. General Dynamics profits from the caging
  of children, and we demand that this despicable process ends now. We will not tolerate
  it. We stand here today because immigration is not a crime.” For more information
