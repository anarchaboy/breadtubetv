description: 'NYC - #RiseUp4Rojava solidarity actions were organized by the Emergency
  Committee for Rojava in several USA cities on January 27, 2019 to bring awareness
  to U.S. citizenry about the revolution in Rojava, and about U.S. aid to the Turkish
  military which had invaded YPJ/YPG-controlled Afrin one year prior. Unicorn Riot
  covered the rally in Manhattan as well as the anti-fascist music festival that took
  place the weekend prior in Brooklyn.'
