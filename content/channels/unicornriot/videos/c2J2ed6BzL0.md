  http://www.unicornriot.ninja/?page_id=7325 A trove of new documents exposes how
  Cleveland’s impending Republican National Convention will subject the public to
  a massive domestic military operation. Following decades of planning and millions
  of dollars spent, the RNC this July will amass into an unprecedented security state,
  constricting the constitutional rights of thousands of people. As the panopticon
  descends on Cleveland, military forces will begin staging security operations at
  NASA’s Glenn Research Center, while other federal forces begin staffing a “Multi
  Agency Communications Center” (MACC), located at the International Exposition Center
  (IX) near the Hopkins International Airport. Visit: unicornriot.ninja Follow: twitter.com/ur_ninja
