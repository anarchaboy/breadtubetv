  two hundred people marched through the Aurora suburb where Johnny Choate, the CEO
  and Warden of the local GEO Group''s ICE detention center, calls home. Many of the
  protesters were carrying signs and banners, and some had musical instruments. They
  were met by about one hundred police officers, with some in riot gear, and by about
  ten far-right individuals associated with the Proud Boys. At the end of the night,
  police arrested two protesters and detained one, spraining the wrist of one of them.
