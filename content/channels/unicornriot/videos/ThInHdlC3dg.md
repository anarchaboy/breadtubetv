description: 'On Saturday, May 6, community members and antifacists from Minneapolis
  and St. Paul resisted the appearance of a "race war" advocate at the invitation
  of alt-right and white nationalist groups in Minnesota. Trump rally organizers disavowed
  the racist alt-right ideals and their rally. For more information: http://www.unicornriot.ninja/?p=15284
