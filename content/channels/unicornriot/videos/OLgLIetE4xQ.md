description: 'As fascist attacks on social centers in Greece and beyond continue to
  spike, Unicorn Riot got an inside look at Notara 26, Greece''s first housing squat
  for refugees and migrants. We spoke with volunteers Mimi, Giannis, and Dionysus
  and took a tour of the self-organized squat, which opened in 2015 and was firebombed
  by fascists in 2016. For more information: https://unicornriot.ninja/2018/greeces-first-housing-squat-for-refugees-migrants-notara-26/
