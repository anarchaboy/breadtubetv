description: '[CC - Greek, English] Workers have successfully self-managed the production
  of environmentally-friendly cleaning products for the last six years in the occupied
  factory Vio.Me. There are no bosses in this factory on the east side of Thessaloniki,
  Greeceâ€™s second largest city. Workers have been in full control since occupying
  the factory in 2013, two years after the workers had stopped receiving paychecks
  from the business due to the parent company having filed for bankruptcy. Unicorn
  Riot brings you inside the worker-run Vio.Me. facility for one in our three part
  video series. We spoke with five of the workers, and gained a deeper perspective
  and history of Vio.Me. For more info: unicornriot.ninja/2019/occupy-resist-produce-inside-the-self-managed-factory-of-vio-me/'
