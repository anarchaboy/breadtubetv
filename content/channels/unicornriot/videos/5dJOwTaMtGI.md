description: 'June 1st, 2017 Throughout #NoDAPL protests, private mercenaries worked
  for Energy Transfer Partners (DAPL) to gather intel on water protectors for use
  by various law enforcement agencies across the midwest to crush the movement. Utilizing
  textbook counter-insurgency tactics, private mercenaries also created social media
  campaigns to counter narratives by water protectors and journalists, and gathered
  further intel using military drone flights over the camps. Support our work: http://www.unicornriot.ninja/?page_id=211'
