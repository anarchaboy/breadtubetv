description: '[CC - Greek, English] Operating voluntarily and organized horizontally,
  the grassroots independent media collective OmniaTV, has functioned out of necessity
  since 2011. Striving to bring out truths misrepresented in Greek media and covering
  under-reported stories, OmniaTV stands out as a viable alternative non-profit media
  source as for-profit and mainstream media controls the TV and radio in Greece. We
  sat down with Loukas Stamellos, one of the co-founders of OmniaTV and Ypopto Mousi
  (translated in English as the ‘Suspicious Beard’) and spoke with Omnia member Alex
  Litsardakis in Thessaloniki. For more on OmniaTV: https://unicornriot.ninja/2019/omniatv-grassroots-independent-media-in-greece/'
