description: 'Denver, CO – In the mid-1800s in the United States people could access
  abortion drugs at the pharmacy without fear of public scrutiny. Nowadays if someone
  wants to get abortion drugs or an abortion procedure, or goes to a reproductive
  health center for one of the many other services they provide, there is a good chance
  they will be harassed by people who want them “to choose heaven.” The chances are
  even higher during two forty-day periods of the year; the first from Ash Wednesday
  to Palm Sunday, and the second starting the fourth Wednesday in September. During
  those times, the Christian pro-life group “40 Days For Life” demonstrates outside
  of reproductive health centers and abortion clinics in 769 cities worldwide; including
  Denver, CO. Read more here: unicornriot.ninja/2018/patients-face-daily-harassment-outside-planned-parenthood-in-denver/
