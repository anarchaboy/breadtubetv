description: 'For the last two years, in the largest city on the small island of Crete,
  the Integral Cooperative of Heraklion (I.C. Her) has operated an autonomous open
  market out of the last bit of free space in the city, Georgiades Park. A network
  of self-organized projects with various local products meet once a month in public
  as a project of I.C. Her, which has started the creation of a new social structure
  and an autonomous economic system. A presenter from I.C. Her spoke at the Athens
  Polytechnic University in early June 2018, for the second Networks of Resistance-European
  Local Struggles Conference. For more information: https://unicornriot.ninja/2018/heraklions-autonomous-open-market-generates-solidarity-economy/'
