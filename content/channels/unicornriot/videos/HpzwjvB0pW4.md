description: 'Denver, CO - On Thursday, January 31, 2019, at the conclusion of the
  first public bargaining meeting between the Denver Classroom Teachers Association
  (DCTA) and Denver Public Schools (DPS) since DCTA voted to approve a strike on Tuesday,
  January 22, 2019, Rob Gould, DCTA Lead Negotiator, told the DPS bargaining team,
  "The offer you have brought today is an example of your inability to listen to our
  educators. From this day forward, you will have no choice, but to listen." We will
  continue to provide coverage on this issue. If you appreciate our alternative media,
