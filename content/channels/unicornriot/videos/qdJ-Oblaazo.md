description: 'A Webinar hosted by the Sheriffs’ Association on May 7 of this year,
  features Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney sharing his history of the events surrounding
  the resistance to DAPL. His presentation, delivered to an audience of law enforcement
  from across the country, presents a tactical and strategic analysis of police and
  military efforts to end direct actions against DAPL and close the water protectors’
  camps. Laney worked closely with the Morton County Sheriff and personally coordinated
  most law enforcement actions throughout months of direct actions, mass arrests,
  and contested pipeline construction. He also sits on the board of the National Sheriffs’
  Association. The Webinar, entitled “Protest on the Prairie: Law Enforcement Response
  and Lessons Learned” took place on May 7, 2017, and is publicly available in the
  National Sheriffs’ Association Adobe Connect portal. We have reproduced a copy of
  it here for educational and archival purposes. READ: Sheriffs’ Association Secretly
