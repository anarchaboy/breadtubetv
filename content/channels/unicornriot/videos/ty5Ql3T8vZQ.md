description: 'Brian Quinones was shot and killed by police after he exited his car
  with a short knife on Saturday night. Following a car pursuit across two Minneapolis
  suburbs, Quinones live streamed to Facebook while driving and captured audio of
  his death in the almost two-hour live stream. Brian Quinones was described by his
  family as a kind, loving person. He was Puerto Rican, a father to a 12-year-old,
  a barber, and an artist. Quinones went by Blessed The MC, and dropped a new album
  called T.I.M.E. (This Is My Everything) yesterday, the same day he was shot and
  killed by police. Read the full story here: https://unicornriot.ninja/2019/minnesota-police-kill-local-hip-hop-artist-after-pursuit/
