description: 'In April 2017 in the Seward neighborhood of Minneapolis, MN a direct
  action took place inside a local progressive cafe. The guerrilla teach-in was in
  response to cafe management silencing employees who were attempting to center the
  needs of survivors of sexual assault. Unicorn Riot documented the direct action,
  interviewed three local survivors who had participated in this act of community
  self-defense, and heard from the action''s co-organizer about the collective power
  of groups to confront and interrupt rape culture. Read the full article here: unicornriot.ninja/2018/survivor-teach-in-highlights-rape-culture-in-progressive-spaces
