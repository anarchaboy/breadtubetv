  the rally thrown by far-right Patriot Prayer that included members of the Proud
  Boys and other groups. Among the counter-demonstraters, was Dizz from Demand Utopia,
  a social ecology organization. We spoke with Dizz about why they were there to protest
  with their giant inflated sunflowers, they said they "we''re gonna suck up the toxins
  of this fascism and wave of white supremacy and start imagining a better world."
