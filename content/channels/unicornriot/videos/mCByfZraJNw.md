description: 'Over a hundred anti-capitalists have created a nine hectare free district
  with urban gardens and a free market as they prevent development plans from being
  constructed in Dijon, France. The occupiers are seeking to preserve agricultural
  land and experiment in collective living while demonstrating horizontal forms of
  community building. Presenters from the self-managed Quartier Libre des Lentillères,
  or Free District of Lentillères, spoke at the Athens Polytechnic University in early
  June 2018, for the second Networks of Resistance-European Local Struggles Conference.
