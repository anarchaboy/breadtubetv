description: 'Communities across northern Syria have begun to rebuild, following the
  cessation of six yearsâ€™ worth of conflict that transformed once-thriving areas into
  bombed-out ghost cities. As battles continue in Deir-ez-Zor, Syrian Democratic Forces
  (SDF) units watch over the recently-captured former Islamic State (IS) capital city
  of Raqqa while residents take steps to re-inhabit the Kobane Canton and other areas
  recently controlled by the IS. Unicorn Riot contributors visited the recovering
  cities of Kobane and Manbij in northeastern Syria as well as the grim frontline
  of armed conflict in Deir-ez-Zor, and obtained photographs from Raqqa. The following
  video presents various elements of life in Syria such as residents fleeing IS control,
  scoping out IS holdouts, clearing booby-trapped buildings in Deir-ez-Zor, as well
  as rebuilding and creating new apartment blocks in Kobane. [CC] Full story: www.unicornriot.ninja/2017/kobane-rebuilds-isil-control-diminishes-syria/
