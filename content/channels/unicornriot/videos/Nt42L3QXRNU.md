description: 'Jeanette Vizguerra is an undocumented immigrant who has been living
  and working in Denver, Colorado with her husband for 20 years. She has three children
  who were born in the United States and one child who was born in Mexico. On Wednesday,
  February 15, 2017, Jeanette decided to skip a scheduled check-in with her Immigration
  and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Officer because she had a strong feeling her stay
  of living in the United States would be denied. Instead, she went into sanctuary
  at the First Unitarian Society in Denver. Jeanette found out later on that Wednesday
  from her lawyer that her stay had, in fact, been denied, and therefore her deportation
  was looming. Since February 15, Jeanette has been living in sanctuary on the church
  grounds 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Follow us on Twitter @UR_Ninja Follow us
