description: 'Police Attack #NoDAPL Water Protectors Defending Sacred Sites: On Wednesday
  morning, a group of water protectors attempted to cross the Cannonball to establish
  a prayer camp on the sacred hill near Cantapeta Creek. They built a wooden footbridge
  so that people could cross the water. Law enforcement responded to the footbridge
  by firing less-lethal projectiles at people attempting to cross, and SWAT officers
  in a boat tore the footbridge away with rope. Several people, including a journalist,
  said they were shot in the back by police with less-lethal rounds at point blank
  range â€“ medics reported that some of these individuals were coughing up blood from
  internal bleeding. Full Report: http://www.unicornriot.ninja/?p=10600 (Weds. 11/2
