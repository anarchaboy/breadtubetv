  It goes completely underreported.” – Ypopto Mousi Journalists from the grassroots
  independent media collective OmniaTV shared with Unicorn Riot the importance of
  their coverage of the Golden Dawn trial. Golden Dawn is a neo-Nazi organization
  turned political party. They are on trial for creating a criminal organization that
  used ‘attack battalions’ across Athens to threaten, beat, and sometimes kill immigrants
  and anti-fascists. For more on Golden Dawn or OmniaTV: https://unicornriot.ninja/2019/omniatv-grassroots-independent-media-in-greece/'
