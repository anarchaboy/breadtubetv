description: 'We dropped by the IoT Village at #DEFCON25 to see what devices they
  were hacking! "The Internet of things (IoT) is the inter-networking of physical
  devices, vehicles (also referred to as "connected devices" and "smart devices"),
  buildings, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators,
  and network connectivity which enable these objects to collect and exchange data."
