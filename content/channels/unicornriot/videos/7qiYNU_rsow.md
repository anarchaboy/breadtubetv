  in a tense standoff between a few hundred supporters of the Patriot Prayer and several
  thousand anti-racist counter-protesters. Portland Police attacked the Patriot Prayer
  counter-protesters and shot dozens of ''less-lethal'' crowd control munitions, one
  of which pierced through someone''s helmet. For more information: https://www.unicornriot.ninja/2018/portland-police-attack-antifascists-defend-outnumbered-hate-rally/
