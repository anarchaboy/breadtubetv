type: video
description: 'Unicorn Riot went to Iceland to take a more in depth look at the consequences
  of human caused climate change. There we spoke with Dr. Halldor Bjornsson, leader
  of the atmospheric & climate research group of the Iceland Meteorological office,
  who called Iceland “ground zero,” for climate change. During our conversation we
  learned that human caused warming of Iceland’s climate already threatens, wild life,
  sea life, and local economies. Dr. Bjornsson also told us that for the first time
  in history, a glacier had been declared dead in Iceland and that in the next two
  centuries all of Iceland’s 269 glaciers would be gone. Support the creation of more
