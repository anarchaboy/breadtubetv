title: 'Modernism: WTF? An introduction to Modernism in art and literature'
description: |-
  Modernism; it can be confusing. So, in today's What The Theory? I wanted to provide something of a modernism crash course. We'll be looking at many different forms of modernist art as well as a tiny bit of modernist architecture and modernist literature.

  I've always struggled to find modernism explained simply and it can be a rather complex theory to get your head around. So, through looking at modernist art techniques, I provide an introduction to modernism as well as beginning to discuss modernism vs postmodernism (although, more of that in the next video!).

  Hopefully, this will be helpful to those of you looking to gain a better understanding of modernism and the many different modernist art movements!
