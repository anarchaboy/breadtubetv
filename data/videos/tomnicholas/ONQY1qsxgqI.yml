title: 'Playwriting Tips: Happiness Ltd | Development Week'
description: |-
  When writing a play, a development week can be a brilliant way to explore your characters and story.  Here's how mine went...

  My name's Tom and I'm a playwright.  As part of writing my new play, Happiness Ltd, I'm documenting my process through a series of ten short videos.  In this video, I report back on a week spent with four incredible actors and director David Prescott getting Happiness Ltd off the page and seeing what works in the hands of actors.

  Follow along as I take you through my playwriting process from initial ideas through to final draft!
