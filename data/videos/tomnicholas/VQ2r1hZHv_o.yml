title: Reading Classic Books for Beginners
description: |-
  Reading classic books can often seem daunting. Classic literature books within the English Literature canon come with a fair amount of cultural baggage and, because of this, many people are put off reading classics. Yet, since I've started trying to read more classics, I've been really enjoying the works of George Eliot, James Joyce, Charles Dickens and others.

  In this video, Reading Classic Books for Beginners, I wanted to share some of the tips I've found helpful for how to start reading classics. In particular, I wanted to make a video for anyone who perhaps is less naturally drawn to this kind of work and is wondering how to read more classics.

  I'm also really interested in making a new series, similar in style to What the Theory? in which I provide some introductions to literary classics. As I mention in the video, if that sounds interesting at all then do let me know down in the comments (and equally if it doesn't!).

  Of course, if you've yet to check out my What the Theory series, then you can check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpyobkolyVE&list=PLIVcDWpMT7Kd3O0eq8b6fMOwvK26vpiWE

  If you've enjoyed this video and would like to see more including my What The Theory? series in which I provide some snappy introductions to key theories in the humanities as well as PhD vlogs in which I talk about some of the challenges of being a PhD student then do consider subscribing.

  Thanks for watching!
