title: 'Playwriting Tips: Ideas | How to come up with playwriting ideas and find inspiration
  for your play'
description: |-
  Finding playwriting ideas and inspiration for your play is the first step in writing a play, whether it's something you've been thinking about for a long time, or pops out at you from nowhere.

  In the second episode of my introduction to playwriting course, I look at how to brainstorm ideas to come up with that gripping plot which will captivate your audience.

  My name's Tom and I'm a playwright.  As part of writing my new play, Happiness Ltd, I'll be documenting my process through a series of ten short videos.  Follow along as I take you through my playwriting process from initial ideas through to final draft!

  Hopefully this series will allow you to pick up some playwriting tips (a kind of playwriting 101 if you will) and teach you to make your plays or other writing for the stage into compelling drama.

  Follow along as I take you through my playwriting process from initial ideas through to final draft!
