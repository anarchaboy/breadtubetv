title: 'How Plays Work: Blasted by Sarah Kane'
description: |-
  In Blasted, 4.48 Psychosis and Cleansed, Sarah Kane uses extreme imagery within her stage plays. In analysing the deep meaning of her work, however, there is far more subtlety in both theme and her use of Derrida's concept of deconstruction.

  In this video, I analyse Kane's debut play Blasted to see what it might teach us in how to write strong themes and cutting imagery into scripts.

  If you've enjoyed this video then please do check out the rest of my channel. I generally put out new videos every Tuesday and Friday discussing theatre and playwriting from the perspective of an aspirant and (some might say) emerging playwright, theatre maker and academic.
