title: 'Playwriting Tips: Happiness Ltd | Research'
description: |-
  Research is vital when playwrighting in fleshing out your play, your characters and your story.

  My name's Tom and I'm a playwright.  As part of writing my new play, Happiness Ltd, I'm documenting my process through a series of ten short videos.  In this video I explain my ongoing research process for Happiness Ltd including playing a bunch of video games, reading books and making my very own game.

  Follow along as I take you through my playwriting process from initial ideas through to final draft!
