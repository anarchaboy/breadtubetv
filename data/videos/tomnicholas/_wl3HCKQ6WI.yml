title: 'Society of the Spectacle (Part 2): WTF? Recuperation, Woke Brands and Capitalist
  Realism'
description: "In my previous video on the Society of the Spectacle by Guy Debord,
  I focussed on creating a summary of the Society of the Spectacle, explained in a
  fairly general sense, particularly placing within the context of the Situationist
  International, May 1968 and Debord's wider work on situationism.\n\nIn today's follow-up,
  I focus on a specific aspect of Debord's concept of the Spectacle: récupération
  (sometimes translated into English as recuperation and sometimes as cooption) with
  reference to \"simulacra\" as defined by Jean Baudrillard and \"capitalist realism\"
  as defined by Mark Fisher and explored through Black Mirror: Fifteen Million Merits
  and the Alfonso Cuarón film Children of Men.\n\nIn particular, I discuss the manner
  in which Debord suggests the Spectacle interacts with radical or subversive ideas
  and movements and how the Spectacle might work to protect late stage capitalism
  from critique.\n\nAs I mention in the video, if you'd like to download a free copy
