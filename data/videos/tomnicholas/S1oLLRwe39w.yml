title: UK Lecturers Strike | UCU Strike 2018 | PhD Vlog
description: |-
  In February and March 2018, UK university students will face significant disruption due to strike action taken by the University and College Union (UCU). I wanted to do a quick PhD vlog which gives a little bit of an insight into why I am striking as well as the potential damage that the current USS pensions dispute could cause to university education in the UK.

  Would be really interesting to have a decent debate about this in the comments, I'm sure there's plenty of people out there with far more info that me.

  If you're affected by the current strike action, then you can find more information about why lecturers are on strike on the UCU website here: www.ucu.org.uk/why-we-are-taking-action-over-USS

  There is also a tool to enable you to quickly and easily send an email to the Vice Chancellor of your university here: www.ucu.org.uk/studentvoice
