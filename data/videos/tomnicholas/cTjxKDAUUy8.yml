title: James Joyce's Ulysses | How To Read It
description: |-
  James Joyce’s Ulysses is perhaps the definitive example of literary modernism. And, despite its reputation as one of the most difficult books to read in all of English Literature, Ulysses by James Joyce—a retelling of Homer’s The Odyssey set in 1910s Dublin, Ireland and featuring such unforgettable characters as Leopold Bloom, Stephen Dedalus (of A Portrait of the Artists as a Young Man) and Molly Bloom) can be an incredibly engaging and rewarding read.

  In the first episode of my new series, How To Read It, in which I provide some accessible introductions to reading classic books, I take a look at Ulysses by James Joyce, delving into some background on James Joyce himself, the basics of the plot and some of the experimental style which makes it such an essential example of modernist literature.

  All this in order to help you to feel that little bit more confident when it comes to reading Ulysses!
