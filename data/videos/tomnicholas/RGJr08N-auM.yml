title: 'Society of the Spectacle: WTF? Guy Debord, Situationism and the Spectacle
  Explained | Tom Nicholas'
description: |-
  Need The Society of the Spectacle explained? Well, in this episode of What the Theory?, we’re doing just that.

  The Society of the Spectacle by Guy Debord (a key member of the Situationist International) argues that contemporary capitalist society has become obsessed with images and appearances over all else.

  Debord argues that “the spectacle” has invaded our everyday lives not just in the form of image-based advertising but also in the way that we interact with one another.

  In this Society of the Spectacle summary video, I provide a brief introduction to Debord’s concept of the spectacle, taking a brief look at the context in which the book was written (including both situationism and the May ’68 Paris uprisings) and unpacking the key arguments included within.
