title: 'Politix: The Cultural Politics of Netflix'
description: |-
  Something I've been planning for a long time, this new series looks at Netflix, Politics and the point at which the two meet. We're going to be taking a deep dive into a number of Netflix Original series in order to explore how they reflect our social, political and cultural context (namely contemporary neoliberalism) back at us through storytelling.

  This won't just involve looking at the various Netflix political dramas such as House of Cards and Designated Survivor but also programmes such as Stranger Things, Orange is the New Black and the various Netflix Marvel series'.

  This video is mainly an introduction and also provides some context. I hope you'll join me for the rest of this Netflix video essay series: Politix, or, Neoliberalism and Chill.

  If you've enjoyed this video and would like to see more including my What The Theory? series in which I provide some snappy introductions to key theories in the humanities as well as PhD vlogs in which I talk about some of the challenges of being a PhD student then do consider subscribing.

  Thanks for watching!
