title: 'The Poetics: WTF? Aristotleâ€™s Poetics, Greek Tragedy and Catharsis'
description: "The Poetics by Aristotle is one of the earliest works of literary theory
  or dramatic theory. Composed between 330 and 350BC, Aristotle's Poetics is a treatise
  on Greek Tragedy and theatre which examines how the narrative structure of Greek
  plays such as the Oresteia by Aeschylus or Oedipus Rex by Sophocles brings about
  catharsis (or katharsis) in an audience.\n\nIn The Poetics, Aristotle introduces
  us to terms such as peripeteia (reversal), anagnorisis (recognition), pathos (suffering)
  and catharsis (purgation) each of which continue to have a huge impact on how we
  discuss narrative structure to the present day.\n\nIn this episode of What the Theory?,
  we consider Aristotle's argument as to the social function of storytelling before
  diving into discussing his suggestions as to how to compose a compelling plot.\n\nFurther
