title: Overcoming Imposter Syndrome | PhD Vlog
description: |-
  Imposter Syndrome (or, for the Americans out there, Impostor Syndrome) can be awful. So, in this most recent themed PhD vlog, I thought I'd talk about some of my own experiences as well as explaining some of the theory behind impostor syndrome with a particular focus on political geography.

  I've tried to also end with some tips about overcoming impostor syndrome in academia which, hopefully, might also be of use in other walks of life. If you have any yourself then please do feel free to drop them down in the comments!

  Here's a particularly interesting blog which takes into account some of the particulars of female experiences of imposter syndrome: https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=7&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiD-JPloIraAhUEyKQKHTFbB4cQFghiMAY&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.co.uk%2Fsian-abigail-bradley%2Fimposter-syndrome_b_13172458.html&usg=AOvVaw2WWOusRNRw2GTgMzxpR0mx
