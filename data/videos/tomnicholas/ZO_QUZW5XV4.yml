title: Top 5 Apps for PhD Students | PhD Vlog
description: |-
  With the new academic year just underway, I wanted to collate together what I think are the top 5 apps for PhD students or, indeed, anyone undertaking a postgraduate course of study.

  There is an endless amount of software out there that can help to make your postgrad life less stressful and boost your productivity. These are what I've found to be the 5 essential apps I use in my PhD.

  Links for those who want to skip ahead:
  01:00 Scrivener (Thesis Writing App)
  03:40 Bear (Notes App)
  05:33 Endnote/Mendeley (Reference Manager)
  08:06 Things 3 (Task Management App)
  09:59 Toggl (Glorified Stopwatch)

  You can download a free trial of Scrivener here: https://literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/download

  To find EndNote with discounted student pricing head here: https://endnote.com/buy

  Bear and Things 3 are both available from the Mac and iOS App Stores (sorry Windows users!).

  And Toggl can be found at https://toggl.com
