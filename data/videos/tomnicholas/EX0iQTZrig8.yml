title: Staying Motivated on Long Term Projects | PhD Vlog
description: |-
  Staying motivated on long term projects can be hard. With the end goal far away, it can be tough to stay motivated with long projects that take upwards of a year.

  This is certainly something I've been finding with my PhD thesis writing. Recently, I've been finding myself in something of a motivational slump and so, here, I thought I'd collect some thoughts on how to stay motivated if you're carrying out a similar project.

  As always, if you've got any motivation tips for PhD students (or people working in any field) that you'd like to share then do feel free to pop those in the comments as well as letting me know if there's anything you're currently struggling with in your working process.

  If you've enjoyed this video and would like to see more including my What The Theory? series in which I provide some snappy introductions to key theories in the humanities as well as PhD vlogs in which I talk about some of the challenges of being a PhD student then do consider subscribing.

  Thanks for watching!
