title: 'Playwriting Tips: Happiness Ltd | Rehearsed Reading'
description: |-
  For a playwright, a rehearsed reading can be a great way to find out more about your play, your characters and your story.  Here's how mine went...

  My name's Tom and I'm a playwright.  As part of writing my new play, Happiness Ltd, I'm documenting my process through a series of ten short videos.  In this video, I sum up what I learned from having a rehearsed reading of the play at The Bike Shed Theatre, Exeter.

  Follow along as I take you through my playwriting process from initial ideas through to final draft!
