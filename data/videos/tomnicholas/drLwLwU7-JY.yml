title: All We Ever Wanted Was Everything by Luke Barnes/Middle Child (Roundabout @
  Summerhall, Edinburgh)
description: |-
  Middle Child's All We Ever Wanted Was Everything opened at The Welly as part of Hull City of Culture 2017 and tours to Latitude Festival and to Paines Plough's Roundabout at Summerhall as part of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe this summer.

  Having caught the company's previous collaboration with writer Luke Barnes a couple of years ago, I travelled up to Hull to catch the play. Here's some of my thoughts and reflections in the form of a performance analysis of the show.
