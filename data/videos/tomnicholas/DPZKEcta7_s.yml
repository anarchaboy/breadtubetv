title: Presenting a paper at an academic conference | PhD Vlog
description: |-
  This week I gave my third academic conference presentation!

  Presenting a paper at an academic conference can be an important part of PhD study. It is an important opportunity for sharing research with other scholars in your field as well as giving you the chance to listen to academic papers from other grad students and professors.

  As such, in this week's PhD vlog, I thought I'd share some of my thought processes as I prepared which might, in turn, provide some tips for conference paper presentation. Particularly, I met a few hurdles along the way as I attempted to turn some work I had formulated as a journal article into a conference paper. Equally, ensuring I made an engaging yet suitably academic powerpoint presentation was something of a challenge!

  If you've enjoyed this video and would like to see more including my What The Theory? series in which I provide some snappy introductions to key theories in the humanities as well as PhD vlogs in which I talk about some of the challenges of being a PhD student then do consider subscribing.

  Thanks for watching!
