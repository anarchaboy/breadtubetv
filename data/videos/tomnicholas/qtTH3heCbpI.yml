title: 'Millennial Socialism and Centrist Dads: Political discourse after neoliberalism
  | Tom Nicholas'
description: |-
  As my Society of the Spectacle videos have been so well received, I thought I'd try out a slightly more overtly political video, putting ideas such as episteme (explored in my What the Theory video on Michel Foucault), Spectacle and Capitalist Realism (a concept developed by Mark Fisher and discussed in my second video on Guy Debord).

  Here, then, I take a look at the idea of "Millennial Socialism", a phrase which has been used to describe the politics of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) as well as that of Bernie Sanders (presumably due to his support amongst millennials rather than his own age...). I then contrast this with a meme which appeared on left-wing Twitter in the UK a few years back: that of the "Centrist Dad" to consider why we might be so interested in this idea of generational political differences and whether such an analysis holds any water.

  I'm particularly interested in how the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis might have shifted popular perceptions of capitalism and engendered what Jurgen Habermas refers to as a legitimation crisis in neoliberal capitalism. Bringing Gen X into the "millennials vs baby boomers" discourse which seems to dominate popular discussions of generation differences, I consider how our present political discourse might be a result of that legitimation crisis and where we go from here.
