title: Beginning by David Eldridge (National Theatre & West End Transfer) | Performance
  Analysis
description: |-
  Beginning by David Eldridge will be receiving a West End transfer (to the Ambassadors Theatre) in the New Year. As such, I thought I'd collect together some of my thoughts on the production from when I saw it at the National Theatre in the form of a short Performance Analysis.
