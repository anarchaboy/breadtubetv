title: The Hypocrite by Richard Bean at Royal Shakespeare Theatre (Hull Truck & RSC)
  | Performance Analysis
description: |-
  The Royal Shakespeare Company was, last week, host to Richard Bean's new play The Hypocrite, co-produced with Hull Truck Theatre as part of Hull City of Culture 2017. Directed by Phillip Breen, the play starred Mark Addy and Caroline Quentin in the lead roles.

  Here's my performance analysis of the production, taking into account the piece's engagement with Kingston upon Hull's central role in the ignition of the Second English Civil War, the production's use of farce and comedy as well as class discourses in its subtext.
