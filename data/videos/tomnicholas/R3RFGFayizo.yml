  | Performance Analysis
description: |-
  This week, I caught Team Viking by James Rowland at the Tobacco Factory Theatre in Bristol. Continuing my series of performance analyses that I began early this year, this short video essay is some responses to the themes and discussions within the play.

  Dates for the rest of the Team Viking UK Tour can be found here: https://www.tangramtheatre.co.uk/copy-of-the-origin-of-species

  Or on James' Twitter: https://twitter.com/jdsrowland?lang=en

  Finally, Tobacco Factory Theatres is a super venue and you can view their programme here: https://www.tobaccofactorytheatres.com

  If you've enjoyed this video then please do check out the rest of my channel where I put out a whole range of videos discussing theatre and playwriting from the perspective of an aspirant and (some might say) emerging playwright and theatre maker as well as reflecting on my experience as a PhD Student.
