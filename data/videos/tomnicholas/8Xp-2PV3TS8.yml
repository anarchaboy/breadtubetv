title: 'A week as a PhD Student | PhD Vlog #5'
description: |-
  Welcome to the fifth of my PhD vlogs. Follow my week as a PhD Student in Theatre and Drama at the University of Exeter. Thesis writing, research meetings and field work. As well as a couple of theatre workshops and rehearsals.

  I've been really inspired by some of the other PhD students vlogging their experiences as grad students at uni or college here on YouTube (particularly SimonOxfPhys who just so happens to be at the same institution myself and Emma Cole) and thought I'd give it a go to see quite how hard it was to keep up a weekly vlog (spoiler alert, fairly time-consuming).

  If you've enjoyed this video then please do check out the rest of my channel. I generally put out new videos every Tuesday and Friday discussing theatre and playwriting from the perspective of an aspirant and (some might say) emerging playwright, theatre maker and academic.
