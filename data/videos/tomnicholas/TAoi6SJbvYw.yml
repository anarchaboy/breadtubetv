title: (Almost) 15,000 Subs Q+A | Ideology, Spectacle, Lefttube, PhD, Research Proposal
  and Essay Tips
description: |-
  As promised: a Q+A! I was gonna wait to put this out until reaching 15,000 subs but, ever keen to keep to schedule, it's going out a few days before. So let's just pretend, okay?

  Packed with questions from subscribers and patrons on topics including defining an ideology or ideologies, some follow-up questions on my What the Theory? video on The Society of the Spectacle, opinions on Breadtube or Left Tube, Lefttube (whichever you prefer), updates on my PhD, writing a Research Proposal or Research Proposals, and some essay tips on choosing an essay topic.

  I hope it's interesting and not too ramble-y. Thanks to everyone who sent in questions for me to answer and to everyone who's signed up to support me on Patreon in the past couple of weeks. If you'd like to do the same then you can find my page at https://patreon.com/tomnicholas

  If you've enjoyed this video and would like to see more including my What The Theory? series in which I provide some snappy introductions to key theories in the humanities as well as PhD vlogs in which I talk about some of the challenges of being a PhD student then do consider subscribing.

  Thanks for watching!
