description: |-
  Essay Tips is a new series I'm going to be putting out every so often packed with academic essay writing tips and research advice. In this first episode, I look at how to start an essay with a hook. How can you grab your reader and make them pay attention to your essay?

  As a current first year PhD Student, I've recently been writing my literature review and the first sentence really matters. As such, I've come up with a few essay tips and tricks to help me kicks start my essays with a bang.

  If you're looking for essay writing help, dissertation writing tips, thesis writing tips, advice for paper writing or simply want to develop your academic writing skills then hopefully this new series might be of some help.

  As always, if you've got any questions or topics you'd like to see me do a video on then let me know in the comments!
