title: 'Postmodernism: WTF? An introduction to Postmodernist Theory | Tom Nicholas'
description: |-
  What is postmodernism? This is certainly my most requested What the Theory? video yet. In it, I hope to provide an introduction to postmodernist theory and postmodernist philosophy. Along the way, we'll look at simulacra and Baudrillard's concepts of a simulacrum and hyperreality as well as Wittengenstein's concept of language-games.

  There are few places online where you can find postmodernism explained simply and clearly. It's a complex theory (as perhaps is made obvious by the length of this video) but, ss always with What the Theory? I hope its the start of such a resource, particularly with so many misconceptions of postmodernism running about online of late.

  Furthermore, while I find the Stanford Encylopedia of Philosophy entry for postmodernism to be far less helpfull than other (usually its pretty ace), here's the link to that if you want to check it out: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/postmodernism/

  If you've enjoyed this video and would like to see more including my What The Theory? series in which I provide some snappy introductions to key theories in the humanities as well as PhD vlogs in which I talk about some of the challenges of being a PhD student then do consider subscribing.

  Thanks for watching!
