title: 'How Black Mirror: Bandersnatch Plays With Narrative | Politix'
description: |-
  Black Mirror: Bandersnatch is the first interactive movie (certainly the first live action interactive movie) in some time to have achieved both popular and critical success.

  Inspired by the Choose-Your-Own-Adventure series of books which reached peak popularity in the 1980s, it features a branching narrative structure and numerous different endings.

  There are loads of videos here on YouTube which purport to be able to explain every Bandersnatch ending. However, in this Bandersnatch analysis, I take a different approach.

  Instead, in this video essay, I seek to explore how the interactive movie form which Bandersnatch makes use of might not only alter the way we interact with this episode of Black Mirror but also change the way in which we derive meaning from it.

  I draw on ideas from Jacques Ranciere’s 2009 book The Emancipated Spectator in order to consider how the interactive form might be seen as an intervention in the “traditional” power structures of the film or television experience.

  In particular, I consider how Bandersnatch’s rendering of the viewer as active in creating narrative choices (as opposed to our usual passivity when watching TV shows or films) might also encourage us to be active in viewing the film critically and to find alternative meanings within it.
