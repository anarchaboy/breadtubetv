title: 'Cultural Materialism: WTF? Raymond Williams, Culture and Structures of Feeling'
description: |-
  In this month's episode of What the Theory?, we're looking at Cultural Materialism, an approach to understanding culture developed by Raymond Williams. Foundational to cultural studies, cultural materialism (a close relation to new historicism), draws influence from both Marxist Literary Criticism and Liberal Humanism in order to develop a "sociology of culture".

  We'll be taking a look at "structures of feeling" including dominant, residual and emergent ideologies as well as an important work in cultural materialism, Political Shakespeare: Essays in Cultural Materialism.

  Finally, I put all of this into practice is undertaking a cultural materialist analysis of 2014's The Lego Movie with a particular consideration of how the film handles discourses of creativity under neoliberal capitalism.
