  Learning how to construct an essay argument can be one of the essential skills that sees your argumentative essay writing go from "kind of okay" to "incredible". So, in response to a viewer request, I've put together this ultimate guide to essay argument structure which is full of argumentative essay writing tips to help you ensure your essays have strong and cohesive arguments.

  As I state within the video, a strong argument should be the beating heart of your essay, it is, in short, its very reason for existing. Ensuring you have a really clear understanding of what your essay's argument is will both save you time and also enable you to ensure your essay has both focus and clarity.
