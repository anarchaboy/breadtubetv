title: Making the most of your Thesis Supervisor | Essay Tips
description: |-
  A supervisor or supervisory team will help you to form a piece of research whether that's for a PhD Thesis, Postgrad or Undergrad Dissertation. They are walking resources of knowledge, tips and advice. But only if you know how to get the most out of your time spent with them. A good relationship with a supervisor can lead to a great piece of writing, a bad relationship, less so.

  This video is my attempt to distill some of the things I've learnt from working with supervisors both on my PhD and MA courses hopefully to help you to make the most out of your relationship with yours.

  If you've enjoyed this video then please do check out the rest of my channel. I generally put out new videos every Tuesday and Friday discussing theatre and playwriting from the perspective of an aspirant and (some might say) emerging playwright, theatre maker and academic.
