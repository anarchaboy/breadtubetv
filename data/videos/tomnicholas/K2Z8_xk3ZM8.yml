description: |-
  Writing the first draft of a play can be an uphill struggle.  Here's some tips I've picked up along the way...

  My name's Tom and I'm a playwright.  As part of writing my new play, Happiness Ltd, I'm documenting my process through a series of ten short videos.  In this video I talk about the triumphs and challenges of writing a first draft of a play including how I use this as an opportunity to develop characters and their voices.

  Follow along as I take you through my playwriting process from initial ideas through to final draft!
