title: 'Day in the life of a PhD Student: Monday | PhD Vlog'
description: |-
  Follow a day in the life of a PhD Student as I begin my week of PhD vlogs. My aim is to record one video from Monday to Friday this week, releasing them two days later (Wednesday - Sunday) to give you a full insight into a week as a PhD student and a broader look at postgrad PhD student life in general.

  There'll be lots of reading academic papers and academic journals as well as books, lots of note taking, PhD thesis writing and (hopefully) some fun stuff too!

  This is something that people have asked for a number of times in the comments of some of my other videos so I hope you enjoy!
