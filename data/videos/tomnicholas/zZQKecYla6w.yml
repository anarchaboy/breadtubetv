title: 'How Plays Work: Seven Jewish Children by Caryl Churchill'
description: |-
  Playwright Caryl Churchill uses narrative arc and story structure to incredible effect in exploring the dramaturgy of an idea in two of her plays Love and Information and Seven Jewish Children.

  I analyse these this incredibly controversial and political piece of theatre using Orson Scott Wells' MICE quotient and Christopher Vogler's Writer's Journey in order to see what we might learn in how to write our own plays.

  If you've enjoyed this video then please do check out the rest of my channel. I generally put out new videos every Tuesday and Friday discussing theatre and playwriting from the perspective of an aspirant and (some might say) emerging playwright, theatre maker and academic.

  Thanks for watching!
