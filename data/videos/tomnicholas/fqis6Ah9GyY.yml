title: 'Library Porn and Understanding Theory | Day in the Life of a PhD Student:
  Friday | PhD Vlog'
description: |-
  The last in my week of daily phd student vlogs in which I go to what must be one of the coolest libraries in the world and make a breakthrough in understanding some tough theory.

  Full series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIVcDWpMT7Kep7qX59xYPyIooeY1S-_CB

  Follow a day in the life of a PhD Student as I begin my week of PhD vlogs. My aim is to record one video from Monday to Friday this week, releasing them two days later (Wednesday - Sunday) to give you a full insight into a week as a PhD student and a broader look at postgrad PhD student life in general.

  There'll be lots of reading academic papers and academic journals as well as books, lots of note taking, PhD thesis writing and (hopefully) some fun stuff too!

  This is something that people have asked for a number of times in the comments of some of my other videos so I hope you enjoy!

  If you've enjoyed this video then please do check out the rest of my channel where I put out a whole range of videos discussing theatre and playwriting from the perspective of an aspirant and (some might say) emerging playwright and theatre maker as well as reflecting on my experience as a PhD Student.
