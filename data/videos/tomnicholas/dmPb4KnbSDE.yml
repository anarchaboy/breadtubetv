  Analysis

  My analysis of Bristol Old Vic's production of Pink Mist by Owen Sheers on its 2017 UK tour at Birmingham Rep (The Rep).

  If you've enjoyed this video then please do check out the rest of my channel. I generally put out new videos every Tuesday and Friday discussing theatre and playwriting from the perspective of an aspirant and (some might say) emerging playwright, theatre maker and academic.

  Thanks for watching!
