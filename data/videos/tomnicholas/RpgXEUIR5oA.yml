title: 'Postdramatic Theatre and Postmodern Theatre: WTF? An introduction to Hans
  Theis Lehmann'
description: |-
  A brief introduction to postdramatic and postmodern theatre as first theorised by Hans Theis Lehmann. The first in a series in which I briefly (and, hopefully, accessibly) introduce some core academic concepts and ideas.

  In this first episode, I explain the scholarship of Han-Thies Lehmann as well as the theatre of Martin Crimp, Sarah Kane, Caryl Churchill, Forced Entertainment, Ontroerend Goed and GETINTHEBACKOFTHEVAN.

  If you've enjoyed this video then please do check out the rest of my channel. I generally put out new videos every Tuesday and Friday discussing theatre and playwriting from the perspective of an aspirant and (some might say) emerging playwright, theatre maker and academic.
