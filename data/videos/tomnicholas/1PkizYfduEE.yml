title: '5 Books for Theatre Students and Theatre Nerds: Get Ahead in Theatre Class
  | PhD Vlog'
description: |-
  This week, a combination of theatre vlog and PhD vlog as I pick out my top 5 theatre books for theatre students, theatre nerds and anyone with an interest in drama who wishes to develop a better understanding of theatre and get ahead in their drama class at university, drama school or elsewhere.

  A list to all the titles in the Theatre & series: https://he.palgrave.com/series/theatre-and/14409/

  And, if you'd like to buy these books, I'm a big fan of Better World Books who both save the planet by selling second-hand books and help to raise money for libraries and the promotion of literacy: https://www.betterworldbooks.co.uk

  If you've enjoyed this video then please do check out the rest of my channel where I put out a whole range of videos discussing theatre and playwriting from the perspective of an aspirant and (some might say) emerging playwright and theatre maker as well as reflecting on my experience as a PhD Student.
