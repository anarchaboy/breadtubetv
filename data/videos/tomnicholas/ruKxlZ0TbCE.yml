title: Junkyard by Jack Thorne (Headlong) at Bristol Old Vic | Performance Analysis
description: |-
  My thoughts on Jack Thorne's latest play Junkyard. Produced by Headlong at Bristol Old Vic and touring the the Rose Theatre Kingston and Theatr Clwyd.

  This is one in a series of performance analyses/reviews that I'm producing while undertaking my PhD at the University of Exeter.

  If you've enjoyed this video then please do check out the rest of my channel. I generally put out new videos every Tuesday and Friday discussing theatre and playwriting from the perspective of an aspirant and (some might say) emerging playwright, theatre maker and academic.
