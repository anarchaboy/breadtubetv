title: 'How Plays Work: An Enemy of the People by Henrik Ibsen'
description: |-
  Ibsen's A Doll's House and An Enemy of the People both engage with politics in intelligent and mature ways, avoiding agitprop-style polemicism and overt persuasion.

  In this video, in order to uncover some playwriting tips for how to write plays of our own, I explore how Ibsen ensures his work remains radical and yet avoids becoming pure propaganda.

  If you've enjoyed this video then please do check out the rest of my channel. I generally put out new videos every Tuesday and Friday discussing theatre and playwriting from the perspective of an aspirant and (some might say) emerging playwright, theatre maker and academic.
