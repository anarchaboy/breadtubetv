title: 'Postcolonialism: WTF? An Intro to Postcolonial Theory'
description: |-
  In this month's episode of What the Theory?, we're diving into postcolonialism with an intro to postcolonial theory in literature, film and culture.

  We'll be looking at the ideas of Edward Said (as laid out in his book Orientalism), Gayatri Spivak (Can the Subaltern Speak?), Homi Bhabha (The Location of Culture) and Stuart Hall (The West and Rest).

  In particular, this postcolonialism crash course hopes to give you an insight into how some of these core ideas of post-colonialism can be used to analyse cultural texts through the critical lens of postcolonial theory. As such, we'll put these ideas into action in discussing James Cameron's 2009 film Avatar and Ryan Coogler's 2018 film Black Panther.
