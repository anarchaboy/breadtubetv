title: The Encounter by Simon McBurney and Complicité | Performance Analysis
description: |-
  Complicité and Simon McBurney's The Encounter, a play which uses binaural technology to tell a story of one man's journey into the Amazon, will be available to stream for a limited amount of time here on YouTube shortly and, as such, I thought I'd do a performance analysis of the production which I was lucky enough to watch live as part of the Edinburgh International Festival in 2014.

  If you've enjoyed this video then please do check out the rest of my channel. I generally put out new videos every Tuesday and Friday discussing theatre and playwriting from the perspective of an aspirant and (some might say) emerging playwright, theatre maker and academic.
