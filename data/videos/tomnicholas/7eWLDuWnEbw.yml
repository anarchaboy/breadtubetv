title: 'Social Class: WTF? Introduction to Bourdieu and Marx on class'
description: |-
  In today's What the Theory?, I take a look social class looking at both Karl Marx's theory of class as well as Pierre Bourdieu, cultural capital and more societally rooted approaches to class in the twenty-first century.

  This video should hopefully be useful for anyone looking to have an understanding of class in sociology, cultural studies and the humanities.
