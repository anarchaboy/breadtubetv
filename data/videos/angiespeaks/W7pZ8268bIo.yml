description: "There's no better way to start off the spooky month of October than
  to join me as I interview David from the amazing Left Tube  horror analysis channel,
  \"Nightmare Masterclass\". Today we will be discussing  The Horror Genre (specifically
  Arthouse Horror) and what this new wave of popularity the genre is experiencing
  says about our current political/ social moment. We will also be discussing feminism
  in horror, the power of the absurd, surrealism and Petscop. \n\nSubscribe to Nightmare
