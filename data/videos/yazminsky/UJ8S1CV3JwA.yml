title: We Need To Talk About Cyberpunk
description: |-
  We need to talk about cyberpunk (the genre, not the game) (okay the game a little bit too). Cybperpunk 2077 has been criticized for its handling of issues related to trans representation and disability, and this criticism made me want to look back at the retro cyberpunk the game is inspired by. We can find that the genre has a lot of negative baggage and regressive worldviews in its roots, and that modern cyberpunk creators have moved past with or engaged with these ideas in ways that other works have failed to.
