title: 'Metropoloid: A Metropolis Remix'
description: |-
  You could fit almost the entire history of videogames into the time span covered by the silent film era, yet we consider it a mature medium, rather than one just breaking out of its infancy. Like silent movies, classic games are often incomplete, damaged, or technically limited, but have a beauty all their own. In this spirit, indie game developer Joe Blair and I built Metropoloid, a remix of Fritz Lang's Metropolis which replaces its famously lost score with that of its contemporaries from the early days of games.
