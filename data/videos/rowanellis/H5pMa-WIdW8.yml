description: "Why is queer history so difficult to find out about? A twitter thread
  about gay WW1 soldiers went viral this week with the hashtag #emilyxaver - and then
  turned out to be fake.  Here's why that matters...\n\nThe thread: https://twitter.com/brendonsexual/status/1071151411436666880\n\nThe
  confession:\nhttps://guillemclua.com/comunicado-sobre-el-hilo-de-twitter-emilyxaver/\n\nResources:\nhttps://twitter.com/Queer_Britain\nhttps://twitter.com/LGBTHistoryNE\nhttps://www.vam.ac.uk/event/bgBXMpPl/lgbtq-tour-2018\nhttps://twitter.com/gaystheword\nhttp://www.thelesbiantalkshow.com/category/podcast/shows/the-lesbian-historic-motif-project/\n\n\n\n___HELP

  and inspiring workshops and talks at events, businesses, and universities across
  the world (see below for more details).\n\nIf you would like to speak about the
  possibility of me running a workshop or speaking at an event please get in touch
  via email: rowanellisyoutube@outlook.com. \n \n\n___WORKSHOPS___\n\nI facilitate
  tailor made workshops, designed to give participants a variety of discussion opportunities,
  interactive elements, and a final longer task individually or as part of a group.\n\nThe
  goal of my workshops is that participants come out of the them with actionable points
  to be put into practice afterwards, rather than feeling as if they had simply talked
  through the same old topics on that subject.\n\n___TALKS & PANELS___\n\nTalks, presentations,
  panels and Q&As allow for an in depth look at a topic or issue. I can deliver solo
  talks on a specific topic and/or moderate or sit on group panels. I have previously
  spoken on topics including:\n\n- Building Inclusive Communities\n\n- Using YouTube
  for social good and charitable efforts\n\n- LGBTQ+ Representation on TV/Film\n\n-
  LGBTQ+ History\n\n- Pop culture and Feminism\n\n- Writing Strong Female Characters\n\n-
  Women on YouTube\n\n- How to use YouTube/social media as a tool in your career.
