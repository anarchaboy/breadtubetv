  ME___\n\nwww.rowanellis.com/book-me/\n\nI deliver engaging and inspiring workshops
  and talks at events, businesses, and universities across the world (see below for
  more details).\n\nIf you would like to speak about the possibility of me running
  a workshop or speaking at an event please get in touch via email: rowanellisyoutube@outlook.com.
  \n \n\n___WORKSHOPS___\n\nI facilitate tailor made workshops, designed to give participants
  a variety of discussion opportunities, interactive elements, and a final longer
  task individually or as part of a group.\n\nThe goal of my workshops is that participants
  come out of the them with actionable points to be put into practice afterwards,
  rather than feeling as if they had simply talked through the same old topics on
  that subject.\n\n___TALKS & PANELS___\n\nTalks, presentations, panels and Q&As allow
  for an in depth look at a topic or issue. I can deliver solo talks on a specific
  topic and/or moderate or sit on group panels. I have previously spoken on topics

  and charitable efforts\n\n- LGBTQ+ Representation on TV/Film\n\n- LGBTQ+ History\n\n-
  Pop culture and Feminism\n\n- Writing Strong Female Characters\n\n- Women on YouTube\n\n-
  How to use YouTube/social media as a tool in your career.  \n\n- & many more.\n\nHelp
