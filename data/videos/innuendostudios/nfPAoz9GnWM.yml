title: 'Why Are You So Angry? Part 6: Talking to Angry Jack'
description: |-
  UPDATE, PLEASE READ: Talking to Jack, it turns out, is complicated: http://innuendostudios.tumblr.com/post/124664414232/talking-to-jack-it-turns-out-is-complicated

  NOTE: if you are interested and financially capable of doing MORE than talking, I recommend picking up a copy of Civility in the Digital Age (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0789750244/ref=as_li_tf_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0789750244&linkCode=as2&tag=civilination-20). It's a valuable resource for improving online communities, and all proceeds go to CiviliNation, a non-profit resource for dealing with and preventing online harassment.
