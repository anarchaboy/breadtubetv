description: "Zero Books Manifesto\n \nThe modern world is at an impasse. Disasters
  scroll across our smartphone screens and weâ€™re invited to like, follow or upvote,
  but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in
  common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing
  process of alienation and atomization.\nZer0 Books wants to work against this trend.\n\n\nWith
  critical theory as our jumping off point, we aim to publish books, record podcasts,
  and create videos that make our readers, listeners, and viewers uncomfortable. We
  want to beyond hot takes and received opinions. Zer0 Books is on the left and wants
  to reinvent the left. We are sick of the injustice, the suffering, and the stupidity
  that defines both our political and cultural world, and we aim to find a new foundation
  for a new struggle."
