  http://bit.ly/SubZeroBooks\n\nThis video is from Brian Francis Culkin author of
  The Meaning of Trump. His book is an ideological critique that sees the election
  of Donald Trump as a completely natural progression to the general trajectory of
  digitized technologies, neoliberalism, and a new breed of financialized capitalism;
  destructive global forces that know no party affiliation or national boundary. \n\n\nBooks

  Books Manifesto: \nThe modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our
  smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking
  is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle and debate,
  the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation and
  atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work against this trend."
