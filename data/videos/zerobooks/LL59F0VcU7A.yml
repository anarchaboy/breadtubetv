  http://bit.ly/SubZeroBooks\n\nAuthor Ben Burgis explains how to handle right-wing
  thought experiments and engage in arguments rather than only relying on snark and
  ridicule to win the day. He takes on two thought experiments from conservatives
  in this video, one involving Brett Kavanaugh and the other involving medicare for
  all.\n\nZero Books Logo Animations and other animations donated by Brian Cole\nhttps://www.instagram.com/robotbloodco/\n\nFacebook:

  at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and weâ€™re invited
  to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend."
