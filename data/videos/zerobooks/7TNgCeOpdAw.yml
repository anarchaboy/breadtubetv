title: The Capitalist Realism of Black Mirror
description: "Charlie Brooker's Black Mirror offers dystopian visions of post-capitalist
  futures. This video examines Fifteen Million Merits and Nosedive, considers just
  how they fit within a Capitalist Realist framework, and determines just how these
  programs might give us a glimpse of post-capitalist societies. \n\nMark Fisher's
  Capitalist Realism\nhttp://www.zero-books.net/books/capitalist-realism\n\nEdmund
  Berger's Uncertain Futures\nhttp://www.zero-books.net/books/uncertain-futures-assessment-conditions-present\n\nSome
  of the music in this episode was created by Jukedeck. \nhttps://www.jukedeck.com"
