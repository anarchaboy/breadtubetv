title: Can the Market Speak? (or Captain Kirk and Ideology)
description: "This video presents a few of the ideas from Campbell Jones' book \"Can
  the Market Speak?\" while juxtaposing Jones' conception of ideology against Marx's
  notions on the subject. To help illustrate the different approaches to ideology
  we turn to Star Trek TOS, and to the episodes The Apple and A Piece of the Action.
