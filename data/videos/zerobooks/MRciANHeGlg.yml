title: Capitalism is NOT a Magic Word (pt. 2)
description: "Part Two of Ben Burgis’ response to the Distributist on whether “Capitalism”
  is a magic word includes a smack down. The Distributist is another soft-reactionary
  willing to publicly demonstrate how little he knows about Marx’s writings and Burgis
  takes him to task for his ignorance. \n\nZero Books Logo Animations and other animations

  Books Manifesto: \nThe modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our
  smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking
  is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle and debate,
  the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation and
  atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work against this trend."
