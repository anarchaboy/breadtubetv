title: 'Ask Eliot (the Anti-Advice Show) Ep 1: Advice Sucks'
description: "DO YOU HAVE QUESTIONS FOR ELIOT? If so leave a comment below!\n\nEliot
  Rosenstock is a therapist living in California who, for legal and theoretical reasons,
  will not be offering therapeutic advice on youtube. His new series \"Ask Eliot\"
  is an attempt to counter the Therapeutic Positivism given expression through conventional
  advice columns and self-help shows. The aim is to go beyond advice-giving to theory
  and emancipation, or if that proves impossible, then to provide a few laughs.\n\nBook

  Books Manifesto: \nThe modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our
  smartphone screens and weâ€™re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking
  is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle and debate,
  the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation and
  atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work against this trend."
