title: Kant's Categorical Imperative Leads to Socialism!
description: "Ben Burgis explains what ad hominem arguments REALLY are, explores Kant’s
  categorical imperative, and argues that YOU MUST BE A SOCIALIST. One must embrace
  the revolution or risk treating people as if they’re merely vending machines.\n\nZero

  Books Manifesto: \nThe modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our
  smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking
  is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle and debate,
  the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation and
  atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work against this trend."
