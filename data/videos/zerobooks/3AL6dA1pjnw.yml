description: "This is an interview with Angela Nagle, a writer based in Ireland. Her
  work has appeared in the Irish Times, the Dublin Review of Books, and the Atlantic.
  Her article “The New Man of 4Chan” for the Baffler was the basis for a book coming
  out from Zero Books next year tentatively titled “Kill All Normies: The online culture
  wars from 4chan to Trump.” We discuss her book, Milo Yiannopoulos, Gavin McIness,
  Laurie Penny, today's internet feminism, 4chan, and how to get beyond the culture
  war.  \n\r\n\r-Video Upload powered by https://www.TunesToTube.com"
