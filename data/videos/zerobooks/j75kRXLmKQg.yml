title: Weird Realism
description: "As Hölderlin was to Martin Heidegger and Mallarmé to Jacques Derrida,
  so is H.P. Lovecraft to the Speculative Realist philosophers. Lovecraft was one
  of the brightest stars of the horror and science fiction magazines, but died in
  poverty and relative obscurity in the 1930s. In 2005 he was finally elevated from
  pulp status to the classical literary canon with the release of a Library of America
  volume dedicated to his work. The impact of Lovecraft on philosophy has been building
  for more than a decade. \n\nhttp://www.zero-books.net/books/weird-realism-lovecraft-and-philosophy"
