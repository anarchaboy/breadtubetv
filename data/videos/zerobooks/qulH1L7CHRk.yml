title: Acid Communism or Will the Revolution be a Trip?
description: "Before he left us Mark Fisher was working on a book on Acid Communism.
  This video explores whether this notion might provide the left with a new, more
  imaginative, understanding of politics. Should we be figuring out how many micrograms
  we need in order to conjure a socialist imaginary?  \nDouglas Lain and MK Hobson
  (author of The Native Star) are featured in this video.\n\nZero Books Logo Animations

  Books Manifesto: \nThe modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our
  smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking
  is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle and debate,
  the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation and
  atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work against this trend."
