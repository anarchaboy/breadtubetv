title: What if US workers won 160 trillion in the lottery?
description: "The question “What would happen if every worker in America won a million
  dollars?” sets up a rather absurd thought experiment, but it’s one that gets to
  the heart of what Marx and Engels really meant when they claimed that the material
  basis of society determined, in the last analysis, what happens in society. \n\nZero

  an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited to
  like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend."
