  video's interpretation of the battle are:\n\nBooks:\nKill All Normies by Angela
  Nagle\nhttp://www.zero-books.net/books/kill-all-normies\n\nAgainst Capital by Cliff
  Slaughter\nhttp://www.zero-books.net/books/against-capital\n\nZero Books Manifesto:
  \nThe modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens
  and weâ€™re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and
  harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet
  has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation and atomization.
  \n\nZer0 Books wants to work against this trend."
