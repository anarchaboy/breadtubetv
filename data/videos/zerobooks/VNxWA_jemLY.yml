title: Capitalist Realism and Mr. Robot
description: "In this youtube video we’ll explore the crisis known as capitalism,
  that is we’ll look at the continued economic crisis, the failed protest movements,
  the retro digital culture, the psychotic businessmen, and even those pesky Russian
  cyberterrorists, only we’ll be looking at all of it through the lens of a TV cult
  hit from the USA television network.  The show is “Mr. Robot” and the question that
  confronts us is whether Rami Malek and Christian Slater are stuck the same capitalist
  realist genre that we are, or have they found a show that can imagine the end of
  capitalism as easily as it can imagine the end of the world? \n\nhttp://www.zero-books.net/books/capitalist-realism"
