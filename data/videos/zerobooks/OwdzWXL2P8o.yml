  http://bit.ly/SubZeroBooks\n\nThis report from the Left Forum for 2018 attempts
  to synthesize two panels, one from the Platypus Affiliated Society and the other
  from the International Marxist Humanist Organization. Peter Hudis’ disagreement
  with the late Moishe Postone leads to the question- “Do we need a dictatorship of
  the proletariat?” or “What does the working class know?” \n\n\nWatch the most popular

  Books Manifesto: \nThe modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our
  smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking
  is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle and debate,
  the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation and
  atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work against this trend."
