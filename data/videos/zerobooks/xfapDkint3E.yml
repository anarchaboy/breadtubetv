title: Evaluating the Žižek vs. Peterson Debate
description: "The debate between Slavoj Žižek and Jordan Peterson was billed as the
  “debate of the century,” but many on the American far left were unimpressed by the
  prospect of it. This video explores what the outcome of the debate might have been,
  critiques the criticism of the debate, and provides an excerpt from Eliot Rosenstock’s
  book “Zizek in the Clinic\". \n[Addendum: At the 9 minute and 20-second mark I credit
  Harrison Fluss for writing a criticism of Zizek in Jacobin. I should have credited
  both Harrison Fluss and Sam Miller.] \n\nZero Books Logo Animations and other animations

  Books Manifesto: \nThe modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our
  smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking
  is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle and debate,
  the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation and
  atomization. \n\n\nZer0 Books wants to work against this trend."
