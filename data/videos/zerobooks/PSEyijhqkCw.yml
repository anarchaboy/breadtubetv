title: The History and Idea of Communism
description: "This video is the first in our new Patreon series of videos on the history
  and idea of Communism. Using Emile B. Ader’s 1970 book “Communism: Classic and Contemporary”
  as a guide, this series will explore the history and ideas around Communism with
  the aim of discovering if there is anything in the Communist Idea worth salvaging.
  The rest of this series will be made available to our Patrons first. In order to
  keep up with this series support us on Patreon.\n\nZero Books Logo Animations and

  Books Manifesto: \n\nThe modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across
  our smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical
  thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle
  and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation
  and atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work against this trend."
