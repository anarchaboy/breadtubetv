  http://bit.ly/SubZeroBooks\r\n\r\nVirgil Texas and Matt Christman are two of the
  five co-hosts from the hugely popular leftist podcast Chapo Trap House and they
  stopped by the Zero Books podcast this week to discuss their new book The Chapo
  Guide to Revolution: A Manifesto Against Logic, Facts and Reason. \r\n\r\nLike Chapo,
  Zero Books has a Patreon. Unlike Chapo we don’t have tens of thousands of patreon
  supporters. We do have over four hundred supporters, however, and we are producing
  a second podcast for this select group every week. We’ve also started a Zero Books
  book club and supporters on Patreon can participate in an online discussion group
  about a select Zero Books title every month. If you enjoy the podcast or just want
  to support the imprint you might consider supporting us on Patreon. \r\n\r\nMusic

  Books Manifesto: \r\nThe modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across
  our smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical
  thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle
  and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation
  and atomization. \r\n\r\nZer0 Books wants to work against this trend."
