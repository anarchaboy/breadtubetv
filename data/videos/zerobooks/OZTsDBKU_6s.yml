  http://bit.ly/SubZeroBooks\n\nThis video is an attempt to tackle the question “Is
  Life Worth Living?” However, it ends up answering a different question, namely,
  “What sort of cultural/psychological structures must be either held onto or created
  if life is going to be meaningful?” \n\nExcerpts from Eugene Thacker’s In The Dust
  of This Planet and Mark Fisher’s Capitalist Realism are featured. Thacker’s work
  is perhaps misread, but in what I hope is a creative and constructive way. There
  is an attempt to turn his pessimism inside out.\n\nZero Books Logo Animations and

  Books Manifesto: \nThe modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our
  smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking
  is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle and debate,
  the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation and
  atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work against this trend."
