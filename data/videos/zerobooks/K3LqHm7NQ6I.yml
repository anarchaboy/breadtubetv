title: Is Postmodernism Conservative?
description: "This video suggests that postmodernism is a conservative philosophy.
  The books covered include Hal Foster’s The Anti-Aesthetic, Mark Fisher’s Capitalist
  Realism, and Matt McManus’ upcoming What Is Postmodern Conservatism? We take a look
  at the difference between parody and pastiche, the difference between Madonna and
  Tommy Smothers, the genius of Richard Linklater’s movie Slacker, and the nostalgia
  of Douglas Lain.\n\n\nZero Books Logo Animations and other animations donated by

  Books Manifesto: \nThe modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our
  smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking
  is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle and debate,
  the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation and
  atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work against this trend."
