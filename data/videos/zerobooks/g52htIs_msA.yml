title: 'Podcast: Zero Squared #211: Burgis on State Capitalism (pt. 2)'
description: "Ben Burgis is a philosophy professor, a logic nerd, a columnist for
  Jacobin, and the author of Give Them an Argument: Logic for the Left. This conversation
  on the podcast came out of a twitter battle Burgis and I engaged in on the topic
  of the State Capitalist theory and the question of whether the Soviet Union was
  State Capitalist. This is the second half of a two-part conversation. \r\n\r\nThis
  week’s podcast is available for everyone. Our patrons get access to two podcasts
  every week: Symptomatic Redness and Zero Squared, but if you’re listening on our
  free feed you’ll always be able to access one or the other podcasts each week. Patrons
  also receive access to our new video series called The History of Communism and
  get access to the Capital Reading group. Book Club members receive electronic copies
  of new Zero Book titles every month and are invited to an online discussion group."
