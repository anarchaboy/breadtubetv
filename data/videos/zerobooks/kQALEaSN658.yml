title: Chapo Trap House, Ad Homs, and Leftist Logic
description: "Ben Burgis returns to discuss logic, Ad Hominem fallacies, inconsistent
  arguments and why libertarians are being inconsistent when they support so-called
  “right to work” legislation in the United States. Also featured in this video is
  a clip from a recent Chapo Trap House live event at Princeton wherein the Chapo
  gang suggested that “logical fallacies are just something nerds invented so they
  can say ‘time out’ in the middle of an ass-kicking.”\n\n\nSign up to win a free

  at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited
  to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend."
