title: Are Humans "Becoming Animal"
description: "This video is in response to both the EDA's book \"Why are Animals Funny\"
  and Eugene Thacker's \"Tentacles Longer than Night.\" \n\nThe move towards the animal,
  the desire for the attainment of animal consciousness, is a move away from the depths
  of our responsibility as humans. It is not a way to escape from meaning, but is
  instead a move to naturalize and so obscure our view of the meanings and structures
  we produce and reproduce every day.\n\nWhy are Animals Funny? \nhttp://www.zero-books.net/books/why-animals-funny\n\nTentacles
  Longer Than Night\nhttp://www.zero-books.net/books/tentacles-longer-night\n\nSome
  of the music in this video was made by Jukedeck\nhttp://jukedeck.com"
