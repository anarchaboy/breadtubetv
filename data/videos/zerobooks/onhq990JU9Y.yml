title: 'The Other Future Podcast #5: Conservatism is UnAmerican'
description: "In this episode of Terry Tapp's The Other Future podcast Terry talks
  to author Jerome Nicolas whose book \"Conservatism is UnAmerican\" was published
  in 2014. \r\n\r\nFrom the book jacket: Our Founders thought a rough economic equality
  was a fundamental to a functioning republic. They had an analysis of where aristocracy
  came from – filthy rich families. Accordingly, many of the revolution’s luminaries,
  like Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and Thomas Paine, openly advocated capping
  and/or redistributing wealth. As Noah Webster warned in 1787, “An equality of property,
  with a necessity of alienation, constantly operating to destroy combinations of
  powerful families, is the very soul of a republic.”  \r\n\r\nRelated Books: \r\n\r\nConservatism
