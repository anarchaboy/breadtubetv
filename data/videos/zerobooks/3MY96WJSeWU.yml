title: On Trump's Scapegoating and the Wall
description: "Douglas Lain was recently interviewed by Isabel Webster on Sky News.
  He appeared in opposition to the failed gubernatorial candidate Peter Lumaj in order
  to provide a left-wing take on Trump’s move to end the government shut down, and
  to comment on the meaning of and prospects for a potential border wall between the
  United States and Mexico. \n\nZero Books Logo Animations and other animations donated

  Books Manifesto: \nThe modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our
  smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking
  is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle and debate,
  the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation and
  atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work against this trend."
