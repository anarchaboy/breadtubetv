description: "Norman Finkelstein is a controversial figure on the left and he’s the
  guest this week. However, while Finkelstein is famous for his books about the Israel/Palestine
  conflict, we don’t discuss that topic, but instead discuss a book he’s working on
  entitled On Academic Freedom.\r\n\r\nhttp://zero-books.net/blogs/zero/category/zero-squared/\n\r\n\r-Video
