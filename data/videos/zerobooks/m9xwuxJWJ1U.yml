title: How to Be an Artist when Nothing Lasts Forever
description: "This video is the third in a series about self-consciousness. This time
  rather than exclusively focusing on Bill Murray or the history of  Dada and Surrealism
  (although they’ll both come up again)we start off opposing Slavoj Zizek’s version
  of Hegelian Materialism against Alan Watts’ Western Buddhism. \n\nWe then take up
  an excerpt from Graham Harman’s book “Weird Realism,” and only THEN return to Bill
  Murray and Avant-Garde art as both appear in the unreleased cult film “Nothing Lasts
  Forever.” \n\n\nZero Books Logo Animations and other animations donated by Brian

  an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited to
  like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend."
