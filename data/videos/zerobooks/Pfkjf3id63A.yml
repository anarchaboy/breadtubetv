title: Positive Realism
description: "A reading from Maurizio Ferraris' book \"Positive Realism.\" \n\"Ferraris
  showed great courage in the brutally anti-realist continental philosophy of the
  early 1990s. He argues rigorously, and is also an erudite and cultured person with
  an unusually good sense of humor.\" - Graham Harman\nhttp://www.zero-books.net/books/positive-realism"
