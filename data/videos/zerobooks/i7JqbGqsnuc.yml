title: 'Zero Squared #141: Class Consciousness'
description: "C Derick Varn is on the podcast again, this time to discuss Lukacs’
  1920 essay Class Consciousness. This conversation goes into the weeds on philosophical

  as well as what we take to be the best and most coherent readings of the essay.\n\r\n\r-
