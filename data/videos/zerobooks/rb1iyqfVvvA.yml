title: Debating Richard Spencer
description: "Taking our cue from Angela Nagle, author of Kill All Normies, this Zero
  Books video addresses an assertion made by the white nationalist Richard Spencer.
  \ While the journalist Gary Younge refused to engage Spencer's assertion that African
  benefitted from their encounters with \"white supremacy\" during a recent interview,
  this video attempts to refute the assertion while pointing out the political dangers
  involved in conflating capitalism with whiteness. \n(This is a slight re-edit in
  order to make the video available in the UK and Ireland)\n\nKill All Normies by
  Angela Nagle\nhttp://www.zero-books.net/books/kill-all-normies"
