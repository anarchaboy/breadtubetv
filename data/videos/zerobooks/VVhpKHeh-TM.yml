  podcast. According to the website Know Your Meme leftypol “consists of users who
  sympathizes with communist ideology and viewpoint. Although many of the memes are
  centered around the USSR and Albania, almost all the users are opposed to both the
  USSR and Hoxhaist Albania. The board is also the home of left-wing discussion of
  ideology and culture, according to the board’s FAQ. The Board is also associated
