title: Slavoj Zizek vs. Jordan Peterson [Revised Rerun]
description: "This is a slightly corrected rerun of a video about how Jordan Peterson
  and Slavoj Žižek have finally set a date and time to debate. The event is entitled
  “Happiness: Capitalism vs. Marxism” and will take place in Toronto’s Sony Center.
  This video aims to serve as a conceptual guide to the debate. How do Peterson and
  Žižek agree and disagree about happiness, capitalism, Marxism, and Christianity?
  \nThis video will feature an excerpt from Ron Roberts book “Psychology and Capitalism”
  as we explore the differences between these two intellectuals.\n. \n\nZero Books

  Books Manifesto: \nThe modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our
  smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking
  is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle and debate,
  the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation and
  atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work against this trend."
