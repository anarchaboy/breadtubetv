title: Capitalism is NOT a Magic Word (pt. 1)
description: "Ben Burgis returns in order to give the reactionary youtuber “The Distributist”
  an argument. Specifically, Ben contends that the word “capitalism” is not magical,
  that the idea that there are “magic words” that shut down thought because they’re
  inadequately defined is dubious given how difficult philosophers have found the
  task of adequately defining simple words such as “table” or “chair” to be, and moves
  on from there to discuss the continuum fallacy. \nThis is part one of a two-part
  video series. The second half of this video will be coming soon.\n\nZero Books Logo

  an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited to
  like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend."
