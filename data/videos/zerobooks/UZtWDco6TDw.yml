title: Ben Shapiro Fans Censor Us! (Or Why We Should Nationalize Google)
description: "Ben Burgis’ last video was reported for violating community standards,
  blocked from suggested videos, and put behind a warning screen. We hold that that
  there was nothing offensive, nothing that violated community standards, in the video.
  This is Burgis’ response to the incident and his call for the nationalization of
  Google, Facebook, Twitter, and the rest. \n\nZero Books Logo Animations and other

  Books Manifesto: \nThe modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our
  smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking
  is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle and debate,
  the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation and
  atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work against this trend."
