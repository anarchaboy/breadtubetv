title: Zizek and Capitalism or Can the Left Avoid Becoming a Bond Villain?
description: "In this video, we take excerpts from Eliot Rosenstock’s “Zizek in the
  Clinic” and the novel “Bash Bash Revolution” as we consider how leftists can avoid
  repeating the mistakes of the past. How can we avoid becoming the equivalent of
  Bond villains? \n\nAlong the way, we compare the Roger Moore films “Moonraker” and
  “The Spy Who Loved Me” and watch some archival footage featuring Charles Manson
  and Jim Jones. \n. \nZero Books Logo Animations and other animations donated by

  Books Manifesto: \nThe modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our
  smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking
  is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle and debate,
  the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation and
  atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work against this trend."
