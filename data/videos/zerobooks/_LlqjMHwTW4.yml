title: Why Are We the Good Guys?
description: "A reading of an excerpt from David Cromwell's book \"Why Are We the
  Good Guys?\" \n\"Cromwell excels in unpicking the multiple deceits driving Western
  foreign policies, the ideological veil that keep us from ever seriously questioning
  the 'benign intentions' of 'our' leaders' or a media which regards itself as an
  associate 'good guy'.\" - John Hilley, Zen Politics\nhttp://www.zero-books.net/books/why-are-we-the-good-guys"
