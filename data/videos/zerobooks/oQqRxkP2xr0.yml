  http://bit.ly/SubZeroBooks\n\nThis video is a response to the twitter dogpile that
  developed after Zero Books author Angela Nagle debated the youtube star and conservative
  “classical liberal” Carl Benjamin. In it we take a look at Nagle’s argument against
  “classical liberalism” and examine how “reading between the lines” can stymy efforts
  to discover the truth.  \n\nZero Books Logo Animations and other animations donated

  at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited
  to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend."
