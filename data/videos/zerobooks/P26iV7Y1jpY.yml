title: The Left's War on Christmas
description: "Many on the right are worried that there is a war on Christmas. Many
  on the left aren’t sure but suspect that there SHOULD be a war on Christmas and
  on Christianity. The history of really existing socialism includes a history of
  state-support for atheism. \nShould the left throw their eggnog in the trash and
  burn the mistletoe? \n\nZero Books Logo Animations and other animations donated

  at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited
  to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend."
