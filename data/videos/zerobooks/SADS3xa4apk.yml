title: 'A New Intro to Zero Books at 50k: Re-Thinking Critical Theory with Guy Debord'
description: "In celebration of recently passing 50k youtube subscribers this video
  is reintroducing Zero Books as we set out to rethink critical theory, starting with
  the Situationist International’s Guy Debord. \nThis video includes a modified dérive
  or an unplanned journey through an urban landscape. The aim of the journey is to
  discover the mood of criticism as it has been laid out by city planners and to arrive
  at some sort of unplanned objective conclusion.\n\nRelated Books \n\nThe Writing

  Books Manifesto: \n\nThe modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across
  our smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical
  thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle
  and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation
  and atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work against this trend."
