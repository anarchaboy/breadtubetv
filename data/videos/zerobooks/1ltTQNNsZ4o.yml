title: The Framing of the Zizek vs. Peterson Debate
description: "Ben Burgis evaluates the framing of the Zizek vs. Peterson debate and
  concludes that the way the debate is being framed includes a category mistake and
  aims at the wrong political goal. The aim of socialism to create the conditions
  necessary for individual and collective freedom and not at happiness.\n\n. \n\nZero

  Books Manifesto: \nThe modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our
  smartphone screens and weâ€™re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking
  is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle and debate,
  the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation and
  atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work against this trend."
