title: The Other Future and The West Virginia Teachers' Strike
description: 'An interview with Kim Jones, preschool teaching assistant, in West Virginia
  during the successful wildcat strike of March 2018.  On Tuesday, after the strike
  ended, Kim wrote: "We won, in the big picture, the day we walked out. Because we
  started a rowdy conversation about economic justice that stretched around the world.
  And we did it, by putting our small differences aside and acting as one for the
  common good. In America, in March 2018, that''s the most countercultural thing a
  group of people can do. It''s almost a miracle."'
