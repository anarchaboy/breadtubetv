title: Acid Communism, Philip K Dick, and the New Culture
description: "In this video, Acid Communism is seen through the mystical experiences
  of Philip K Dick, the projects of Terence McKenna and Timothy Leary, and through
  some personal anecdotes from Douglas Lain. Along the way, Lain summarizes the Philip
  K Dick story “The Electric Ant” and quotes excerpts from Mark Fisher’s Capitalist
  Realism, Fritjhof Bergmann’s New Work/New Culture, and Lain’s own short story “Noam
  Chomsky and the Timebox.” \n\nZero Books Logo Animations and other animations donated

  an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited to
  like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend."
