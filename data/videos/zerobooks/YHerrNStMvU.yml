title: How Plato's Forms led to Socialism
description: "This video is a call for submissions for our new line of books. Realizing
  Philosophy will take up what’s called the Western tradition with the aim not only
  of understanding the history of ideas but of realizing them. Inspired by Andrew
  Feenberg’s book “Realizing Philosophy” we are now aiming to create a series of introductory
  philosophy books written from a Marxist perspective. \n\nThis video is a call for
  a book that introduces readers to Plato’s theory of the forms while outlining how
  Platonic forms and the commodity form are connected through opposition.  \n\nZero

  Books Manifesto: \nThe modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our
  smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking
  is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle and debate,
  the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation and
  atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work against this trend."
