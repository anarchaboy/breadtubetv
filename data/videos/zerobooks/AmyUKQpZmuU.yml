  http://bit.ly/SubZeroBooks\n\nThis video is a call for submissions for a new line
  of books. Realizing Philosophy will take up what’s called the Western tradition
  with the aim not only of understanding the history of ideas but of realizing them.
  Inspired by Andrew Feenberg’s book “Realizing Philosophy” we are now aiming to create
  a series of introductory philosophy books written from a Marxist perspective. \n\nContact

  at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited
  to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend."
