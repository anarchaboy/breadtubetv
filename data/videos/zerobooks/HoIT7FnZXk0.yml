  http://bit.ly/SubZeroBooks\n\nThis video uses the NBC television program The Good
  Place and the Netflix Original Series Queer Eye in order to demonstrate the limitations
  of intersectionality, not as a way to understand the consequences of various oppressions
  within this society, but as the theoretical foundation for an emancipatory politics.

  at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and weâ€™re invited
  to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend."
