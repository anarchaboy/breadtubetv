title: 'We Live in a Society Ep. 2: Are the Young Revolutionary?'
description: "A lot of Marxist sects and left organizers focus their recruitment efforts
  on students. Many others think that young people are inherently radical. In this
  second episode of WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY author MK Hobson (Native Star-https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003F3PKFY)
  and Zero Books publisher and author Douglas Lain (Bash Bash Revolution-https://www.amazon.com/Bash-Revolutio...)
  question this view as they explore and explain the topic “Generational Politics”
  \n\nWE LIVE IN A SOCIETY is a new monthly video series modeled on educational television
  programs like 3...2...1 Contact and Square One Television, only rather than explaining
  the natural sciences, WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY aims to explore Critical Theory of the
  Marxist variety. \n\nIn this second episode, the Zero Books titles Millennials and
  the Moments that Made Us, and Can the Left Learn to Meme are cited. \n\nZoomers
  featured include:\n\nNoah Lain as boy in hat.\nBenjamin Lain (@chickenfrend ) as
  young man in commie t-shirt.\nTimothy Schatz (@AnorSurrealCent) as the Zoomer with

  an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited to
  like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend."
