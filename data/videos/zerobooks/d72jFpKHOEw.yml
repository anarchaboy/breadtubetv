  Immigration: It's About Power we take excerpts from Agata Pyzik’s “Poor But Sexy”
  and Yasin Kakande’s “Slave States” in order to explore the true impact of undocumented
  workers on the economy and on wages, and in order to explore what the consequence
  of offering a path towards citizenship might really be for both the native working
  class and for the working class as a whole. \n\n\nZero Books Logo Animations and

  at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited
  to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend."
