title: Will Bernie Sanders Turn the United States Into Venezuela?
description: "Ben Burgis takes on the absurd idea that Venezuela's woes undermine
  the appeal of a US socialist transformation while arguing for left unity around
  Bernie Sander's presidential run. \n\nSupport Zero Books on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/zerobooks\nSubscribe:

  an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and weâ€™re invited to
  like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend."
