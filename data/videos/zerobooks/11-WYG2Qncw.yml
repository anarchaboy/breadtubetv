title: Her Sexuality Against Philosophy
description: "Victoria Brooks F*%king Law is an urgent call for everyone, not just
  academics and researchers, to find inventive ways to question the ethics of sexuality
  and to question ethics through sexuality. McManus and Hamilton's What is Postmodern
  Conservatism asks how we got from the so-called end of history to apocalyptic declarations
  of the end of western civilization. Both books are addressing Postmodernism only
  in different ways.\n\nRelated Books:\nFucking Law by Victoria Brooks\nWhat is Post-Modern

  an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and weâ€™re invited to
  like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend."
