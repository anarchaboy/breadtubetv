  http://bit.ly/SubZeroBooks\n\nThis video takes up and takes on a new book that is
  not out from Zero Books, but from Oxford University Press. The Elephant in Your
  Brain argues, among other things, that all human conversations are about virtue
  signalling. \n\nMark Fisher’s Capitalist Realism is brought to bear on this question
  of virtue signalling online and in general, the problem of unconscious motivation
  for revolutionaries, and the need to get beyond immediate self-interest.\n\nCapitalist
  Realism by Mark Fisher \nhttp://www.zero-books.net/books/capitalist-realism\n\n\nSupport

  Books Manifesto: \nThe modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our
  smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking
  is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle and debate,
  the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation and
  atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work against this trend."
