title: Lindsay Shepherd and the pseudo-Free Speech Movement
description: "This video addresses Lindsay Shepherd's announcement that she was leaving
  the left as well as the right-wing's opportunistic embrace of free-speech. There
  is no commitment to free speech and free thinking on the right, rather there is
  only the weaponization of the left's failure to be consistent and sensible.\n\nKill
