  http://bit.ly/SubZeroBooks\n\nThis is the second video in a series of two videos
  on the topic of the Intellectual Dark Web. How and why are these free speech warriors
  misunderstanding Marx and how is it that Capitalist Realism is contributing to the
  rise of the right and the weakness of the left.\n\nCheck out Brendan Cooney's youtube
  channel on Marxism.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3F695D99C91FC6F7\n\nWatch

  \nThe modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens
  and weâ€™re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and
  harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet
  has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation and atomization.
  \n\nZer0 Books wants to work against this trend."
