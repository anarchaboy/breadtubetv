title: The Difference Between Socialism and Social Democracy
description: "The history of really existing socialist parties in Europe has been
  the history of social democracy. In this video the differences between social democratic,
  Bolshevik, and Marxist understandings of Marx are highlighted. We also consider
  how Anselm Jappe’s “The Writing on the Wall” suggests anti-politics as a solution
  for the impasse between socialism and social democracy. \n\nZero Books Logo Animations

  an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited to
  like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend."
