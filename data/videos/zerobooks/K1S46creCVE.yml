title: 'Zero Squared #134: Sci-Fi Utopias and the Far Right'
description: "David Auerbach is an American writer with a background in software engineering.
  He has written on a variety of subjects, including social issues and popular culture,
  the environment, computer games and literature. In this episode we discuss an essay
  he wrote for the Daily Beast in September of this year entitled “The Sci-Fi Roots
  of the Far Right.”\r\n\r\nI want to remind you that we’ve moved the Inside Zero
  Books podcast from the Zero Books blog to Patreon. This will make it easier to get
  the member’s only podcast on podcatchers. It also means that we’ll be repeating
  the first year of Inside Zero Books daily on our Patreon account. If you missed
  Inside Zero Books podcast the first time, or if you just want to hear the old episodes
  again, they’ll be available.\r\n\r\nI want to urge you to pick up Anselm Jappe’s
  The Writing on the Wall, Philip Cunliffe’s Lenin Lives, and the first book in a
  new line of books from Zero: Neglected or Misunderstood: Introducing Theodor Adorno.
  The Neglected or MisUnderstood series presents philosophers of the left that are
  either little known or widely misread. Stuart Walton starts the series with a look
  at Adorno, who has been for everything from the Beatles to postmodernism\r\n\r\nIncluded
  in this episode are clips from Barry Malzberg’s Beyond Apollo and Issac Asimov’s
  Foundation Trilogy. The music includes the theme from The Quiet Earth.\n\r\n\r-
