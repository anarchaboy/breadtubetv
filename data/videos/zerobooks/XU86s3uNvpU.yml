title: 2018 Rewind (Marxist Version)
description: "This video is dedicated to Moishe Postone who passed in 2018. \n\nThis
  New Year’s Eve we’ll rewind in order to examine the temporal character of capitalism.
  While taking excerpts from Capitalist Realism and Ghosts of My Life, this video
  is mostly an exploration of Moishe Postone’s “Time, Labor and Social Domination.”

  at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited
  to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend."
