title: 'Zero Books Podcast #98: A Red Worker from a Red State'
description: "Terry Tapp is a red worker from a red state. He’s also an artist and
  a writer. His book, \"A Serf’s Journal: The Story of the United States’ Longest
  Wildcat Strike\" is coming out from Zero Books in 2017.\r\n\r\nMicah Uetricht of
  Jacobin Magazine blurbed the book this way:\r\n\r\nEvery day, millions of people
  grind their way through miserable work. And every day, a few of them decide the
  status quo cannot stand — they have to fight back. Very few of either of those stories
  ever get told, particularly by the heroic people who lived them. Terry Tapp does
  both in a tale of unbelievably miserable, dangerous work and courageous, fed-up
  workers up against incredibly tall odds. Anyone who has worked a terrible job should
  read it. Anyone who has dreamed about fighting back should study it.\n\r\n\r-Video
