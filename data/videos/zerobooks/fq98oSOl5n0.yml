title: Join the Cult of Bill Murray?
description: "According to the New York Times, Bill Murray has become a secular saint.
  Douglas Lain flirts with the idea of joining the Cult of Murray in this video while
  working to rehabilitate Hegel’s notion of Spirit or Geist. Can we overcome ourselves
  by embracing the contradiction of modern life?  \n\nZero Books Logo Animations and

  Books Manifesto: \nThe modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our
  smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking
  is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle and debate,
  the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation and
  atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work against this trend."
