  http://bit.ly/SubZeroBooks\n\nThis video considers what it would take to change
  both the material and ideological basis of modern society by taking excerpts from
  Alfie Bown’s Enjoying It: Candy Crush and Capitalism and Douglas Lain’s Bash Bash
  Revolution. The video features clips from an unfinished short based on Lain’s novel.

  at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited
  to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend."
