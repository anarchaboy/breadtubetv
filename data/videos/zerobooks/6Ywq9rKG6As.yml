title: 'Zero Squared #207: Defining Capitalism [teaser]'
description: "Nikos Sotirakopoulos and Ashley Frawley join me in this second episode
  in what promises to be a new series of podcasts. Nikos is a committed Randian while
  Ashley Frawley and I are both Marxists and we debate how to define and understand
  capitalism with Nikos in this episode.\r\n\r\nThis week’s podcast is available for
  our patrons. Our Patreon supporters get access to two podcasts every week: Symptomatic
  Redness and Zero Squared, but if you’re listening on our free feed you’ll always
  be able to access one or the other podcasts each week. At the moment we have 632
  patrons. When we reach 1000 patrons we’ll begin production of a documentary on Western
  Marxism and Post-Marxism. \r\n\r\nRelated Books \r\n\r\nThe Semiotics of Happiness

  Books Manifesto: \r\n\r\nThe modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across
  our smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical
  thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle
  and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation
  and atomization. \r\n\r\nZer0 Books wants to work against this trend."
