title: Michel Houellebecq and The Liar's Paradox
description: |-
  This video is about the impossibility of nihilism, the phony honesty of Michel Houellebecq, and how to find the meaning of life. Jumping off from Ben Jeffrey's book Anti-Matter we poke holes in the concept of ‘Depressive Realism’ and then fill those holes in again.

  Merry Christmas!
