title: Critiquing Dirty Dancing
description: The 1987 film Dirty Dancing is the very definition of a cultural, and
  one might add a surprise, phenomenon. A box office taking of $10 million dollars
  by the film's 10th day on screen. $170 million worldwide from a production budget
  of just $6 million. the film still to this to this day rakes up a million DVD sales
  per year. Dirty Dancing is perhaps the epitome of the so called 'Chick Flick' Yet
  the film has some serious social themes working under its flaying skirt. Politics
  of class, the failings of liberalism in sixties America and beyond, abortion, courting
  and sex out of wedlock, the collapse of the nuclear family unit, and all this set
  against a generational shift that was imminent in the year of the films setting,
  1963. Take away the euphoric Dancing, and all that is left is dingy and Dirty.  -Stephen
