description: "This video covers the books \"The Off Modern\" by Ron Roberts, \"Fear
  of Music\" by David Stubbs, and Capitalist Realism by Mark Fisher. The suggestion
  raised is that we might expect that attempts to escape from established conventions
  always means risking madness and noise. \n\nThe Off Modern\nhttp://www.zero-books.net/books/off-modern\n\nFear
