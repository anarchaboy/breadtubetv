title: 'The Other Future Podcast #7: Vale-Search and Destroy and More'
description: "In this episode of The Other Future, Terry Tapp talks with the cultural
  icon V. Vale. Vale began the influential punk magazine, Search and Destroy, and
  through his publication imprint, Re/Search Pubs, he brought William Burroughs and
  JG Ballard to the American public, essentially created industrial music and culture,
  gave voice to the modern tattoo renaissance, and continues to work and push the
  creative envelope today.\r\n\r\nSupport Zero Books on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/zerobooks\r\nSubscribe:

  is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and weâ€™re invited
  to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. \r\n\r\nZer0 Books wants
  to work against this trend."
