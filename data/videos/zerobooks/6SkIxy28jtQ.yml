title: A Response to Slavoj Žižek on “Transgender Dogma”
description: "This video responds to Slavoj Žižek’s recent essay for the Spectator
  entitled “Transgender dogma is naive and incompatible with Freud” by quoting from
  David Blacker’s new book “What’s Left of the World.” In this one, we explain the
  difference between the ideal-ego and the ego-ideal, play the “let’s get canceled”
  drinking game, and play a clip of the podcaster and comic strip artist KMO from
  his youtube channel Outta My Head.\n\nZero Books Logo Animations and other animations

  an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited to
  like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend."
