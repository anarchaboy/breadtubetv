title: Christopher Lasch, The Alt-Left, and Capitalist Realism
description: |-
  This video traces a critique of digital modernity through three Zero Books titles: Capitalist Realism, Babbling Corpse, and Ghosts of My Life. In it we also consider how the sometimes conservative and sometimes radical critic Christopher Lasch offered a similar critique back in the 20th century and attempt to understand what some centrist democrats are calling the Alt-Left.
