  is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited
  to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. \r\n\r\nZer0 Books wants
  to work against this trend."
