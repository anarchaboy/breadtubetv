title: 'Inside Zero Books #64: Thaddeus Russell Against Rationalism (part 2)'
description: "A few months back this episode of Inside Zero Books was made available
  to our Patreon supporters. I'm releasing it now in an effort to encourage people
  to support us on Patreon and as a favor to a few listeners who said they couldn't
  afford to donate through Patreon but who wanted to hear the second half of this
  conversation. \nHere's the original description: \nThaddeus Russell is a historian,
  author, and professor. He has taught history, American Studies, and the history
  of philosophy at Columbia University, Barnard College, and the New School for Social
  Research. He is also the host of the Unregistered Podcast.\nIn this second half
  of Russell's conversation for Zero Books he discusses Marx's LTV, why the working
  classes don't feel exploited, and why he believes both gender and the biological
  notion of sex is a social construct.\nThis half of the conversation does not just
  fade out at the end, but rather ends with Russell asserting his conviction that
  Lain is well on his way to converting to postmodernism.\n\nHere's the link to the
  first half of this conversation: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygkfx9wMp-A&t=2s"
