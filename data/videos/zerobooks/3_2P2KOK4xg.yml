title: Zizek’s Sublime Object and Street Fighter 2
description: "This video series presents a careful reading of Slavoj Zizek’s “The
  Sublime Object of Ideology” while turning to various video games to provide clarifications
  of key concepts. In this third installment Marx’s notion of the Commodity fetish
  is compared to Freud’s approach to interpreting dreams. \n\n\nRelevant Books\n\nZizek

  an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited to
  like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend."
