title: 'Zero Squared #137: On the Radical Empiricism of Rhetoric'
description: "Daniel Coffeen is the author of the Zero Books title \"Reading the Way
  of Things\" and a frequent guest on this podcast and many others including the Partially
  Examined Life. \r\n\r\nIn this episode we discuss his essay: \"On the Radical Empiricism
  of Rhetoric.\" \r\n\r\nHere's an excerpt:\r\n\r\n\"A rhetorical reckoning riles
  many people up as it doesn't try to ground itself or its going in anything outside
  itself — in a truth or axiom or universal claim. It is indifferent to such things
  except in as much as such things are arguments, things to reckon. And so rather
  than ever being tethered or even seeking a tether, the rhetorician begins to enjoy
  all the different ways different things can go. It reads multiple ways to reckon
  a puppy or ballet or chair. Rather than stake a single claim, she — our rhetorician
  — takes delight in the going of things, in the possible ways of things. Which can
  be infuriating to someone who's adamant in a single belief. This is what ballet
  is!\"\n\r\n\r- video upload powered by https://www.TunesToTube.com"
