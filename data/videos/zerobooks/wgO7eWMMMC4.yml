title: Replying to Gene Epstein on Worker-Owned Pizza Shops
description: "Ben discusses deep-dish pizza and replies to Gene Epstein's argument
  that the only legitimate way to bring about an economy based on workers' control
  is for workers to gamble their retirement savings to start worker-owned businesses.
  For more content, you can check out Ben's Patreon, where he posts short public YouTube
  videos every day as well as two patron-only essays and one longer patron-only video

  an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited to
  like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend."
