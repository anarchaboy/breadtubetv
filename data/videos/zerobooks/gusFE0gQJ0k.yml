title: 'We Live in a Society Ep. 1: Are You Being BRAINWASHED?'
description: "A lot of critical theory approaches the media as a form of propaganda
  or brainwashing. In this first episode of WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY author MK Hobson
  (Native Star-https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003F3PKFY) and Zero Books publisher and
  author Douglas Lain (Bash Bash Revolution-https://www.amazon.com/Bash-Revolution-Douglas-Lain-ebook/dp/B07H472CHB)
  question this view as they explore and explain the topic “Ideology and Media.” \n\nWE
  LIVE IN A SOCIETY is a new monthly video series modeled on educational television
  programs like 3...2...1 Contact and Square One Television, only rather than explaining
  the natural sciences, WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY aims to explore Critical Theory of the
  Marxist variety. \n\nIn this episode the Zero Books titles Neglected or Misunderstood:
  Introducing Theodor Adorno, Give Them an Argument, and the Coming Revolution are
  cited.\n\nZero Books Logo Animations and other animations donated by Brian Cole\nhttps://www.instagram.com/robotbloodco/\n\n\nRelated

  an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited to
  like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend."
