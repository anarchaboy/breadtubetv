title: 'We Live in a Society Ep. 3: Defending Consumerism?'
description: "Many believe that socialism is a struggle to overturn the market and
  that revolutionaries should attempt to deprogram the masses who have been suckered,
  brainwashed, and ultimately corrupted by cheap consumer goods. In this third episode
  of WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY author MK Hobson (Native Star-https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003F3PKFY)
  and Zero Books publisher and author Douglas Lain (Bash Bash Revolution-https://www.amazon.com/Bash-Revolutio...)
  question this view as they explore and explain the topic of “Anti-Consumerism” while
  taking an excerpt from Swift’s “A Left For Itself” \n\nWE LIVE IN A SOCIETY is a
  new monthly video series modeled on educational television programs like 3...2...1
  Contact and Square One Television, only rather than explaining the natural sciences,
  WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY aims to explore Critical Theory of the Marxist variety. \n\nAlso

  an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited to
  like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend."
