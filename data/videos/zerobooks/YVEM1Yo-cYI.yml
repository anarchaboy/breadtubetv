title: Stefan Molyneux Doesn't Know Arguments
description: "Ben Burgis recounts his twitter encounter with the reactionary race
  realist youtuber and “logic” bros Stefan Molyneux. It turns out that Molyneux doesn’t
  know the difference between a sound and a valid argument, but he’s also unwilling
  to be corrected. Molyneux’s blocking Burgis on twitter and his subsequent subtweeting
  was “not an argument.”\n\nZero Books Logo Animations and other animations donated

  Books Manifesto: \nThe modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our
  smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking
  is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle and debate,
  the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation and
  atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work against this trend."
