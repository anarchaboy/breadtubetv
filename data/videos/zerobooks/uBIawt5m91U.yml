  Fascism and how to be beat it?” by referring to Angela Nagle’s 2017 essay “Goodbye,
  Pepe,” and Gilles Dauve. Are the Proud Boys where the fascist movement has rebranded
  itself after Charlottesville? If so, what do we do about it?\n\nBook Mentioned \n\nKill

  Books Manifesto: \nThe modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our
  smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking
  is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle and debate,
  the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation and
  atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work against this trend."
