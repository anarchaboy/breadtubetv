  Books Manifesto: \n\nThe modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across
  our smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical
  thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle
  and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation
  and atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work against this trend."
