title: 'Zizek and the Stanley Parable: Guide to Sublime Object of Ideology (pt. 1)'
description: "Slavoj Žižek is perhaps the world’s most famous philosopher. However,
  the arguments of the “Elvis of Critical Theory” are sometimes difficult to fully
  grasp, but we'll follow his example and use pop cultural reference in an attempt
  to make the ideas more accessible. This video series will take on the ideas in Žižek’s
  first book: The Sublime Object of Ideology in an effort to explicate and evaluate
  them. Find out if Žižek’s is a philosophy without milk or without cream and ENJOY
  eating from the trashcan.\n\nRelated Books \n\nIdeology and the Virtual City: Videogames,

  Books Manifesto: \n\nThe modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across
  our smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical
  thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle
  and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation
  and atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work against this trend."
