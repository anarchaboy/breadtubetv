title: Peterson and His Lobsters vs. Logic
description: "Ben Burgis, author of the upcoming book “Give Them an Argument: Logic
  for the Left” demonstrates why Jordan Peterson and his fans must logically accept
  that worker control of the means of production is a possible alternative to hierarchical
  capitalist relations.\n\nLink to Debate with PSA Sitch and Friended\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sRklq0lx6Y&t=144m33s\n\nZero

  Books Manifesto: \nThe modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our
  smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking
  is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle and debate,
  the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation and
  atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work against this trend."
