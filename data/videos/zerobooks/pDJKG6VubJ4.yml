title: Chomsky vs Žižek (Electric Dreams and Real Life)
description: "This video is part one of a two-part exploration of modernism. It explores
  the television program Electric Dreams, and specifically the episode 'Real Life'
  as it sets up some ontological concepts in preparation for a video that will consider
  whether a radical change as, defined by the modernism, is possible. Before we ask
  that question we first have to answer questions like: \nHow do we test the limits
  of what we can know about the social world? Do our theories have to be falsifiable
  in a positivist sense? And, secretly, we'll ask \"Shall we be Kantians?\""
