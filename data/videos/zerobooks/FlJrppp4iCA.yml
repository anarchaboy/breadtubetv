title: The Philosophy of Lungfish
description: "Terry Tapp is the artist and author behind the Lungfish project. \"The
  Lungfish Project\" is a three-part graphic novel series and Kickstarter project
  bringing picto-philosophy to the masses. He is the Zero Books author of “A Serf’s
  Journal,” and a returning guest to this podcast.\r\n\r\nCheck out his project on
  Kickstarter:\r\n https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1132611188/the-lungfish-project
  \r\n\r\nThis week’s podcast is available in full for everyone. Our Patreon supporters
  get access to two podcasts every week: Symptomatic Redness and Zero Squared, but
  if you’re listening on our free feed you’ll always be able to access one or the
  other podcasts each week. At the moment we have 594 patrons, but we did reach 600
  patrons last month. Therefore, we’ll introduce the new series of patron only videos
  tentatively entitled Communism 101 by the end of May and I expect that we’ll be
  able to get over 600 again and continue on with the series in the months to come."
