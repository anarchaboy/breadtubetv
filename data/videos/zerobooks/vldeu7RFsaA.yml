title: How Slavoj Zizek TRIGGERED Jordan Peterson
description: "Support Zero Books on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/zerobooks\n\nHow
  Slavoj Zizek provoked Jordan Peterson: \nZizek's essay for the Independent \"Why
  do people find Jordan Peterson so convincing?\" provoked a defensive reaction from
  both Peterson and his fans. This video will explore just why Žižek wrote the essay
  the way he did and how Žižek's assessment that Peterson's hot takes on subjects
  like white privilege and neo-Marxists ought to be slotted next the pseudo-observations
  of clowns like Milo Yiannopoulos. \n\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/SubZeroBooks\nWatch

  Books Manifesto: \nThe modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our
  smartphone screens and we’re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking
  is harder and harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle and debate,
  the internet has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation and
  atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work against this trend."
