title: The Spectacle vs Capitalism (Snowpiercer vs Go West)
description: "In this video we take up the musical genre of vaporwave again in order
  to understand the Capitalist Realist moment we’re trapped in. We also consider the
  movie Snowpiercer as we take up an essay by the post-Marxist McKenzie Wark who,
  in his essay The Sublime Language of My Century, criticized Marx’s critique of political
  economy in the same way that a music critic might criticize a pop song.  \n\nCapitalist
