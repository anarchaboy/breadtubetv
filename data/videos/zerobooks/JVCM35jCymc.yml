title: 'Zero Squared #125 Overcoming Capitalism'
description: "Terry Tapp is an artist and writer living in New York City. Originally
  from Central Appalachia, Terry spent many years working trade jobs, wandering through
  the American south, all the while creating art and writing. His book A Serfâ€™s Journal
  is a formidable first-hand account of American workers in Jeffersonville, Indiana,
  as they fought a multinational company and their corrupt union to stage the longest
  wildcat strike in US history. Tapp is the guest this week as we discuss overcoming
  capitalism.\n\r\n\r-Video Upload powered by https://www.TunesToTube.com"
