  for the Left, addresses the question “Is socialism against human nature?” in this
  video. Burgis believes that the left would do well to take on bad arguments and
  that the rules of logic favor the left. \n\nZero Books Logo Animations and other

  at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens and we’re invited
  to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and harder to find. Rather
  than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet has sped up and deepened
  a long-standing process of alienation and atomization. \n\nZer0 Books wants to work
  against this trend."
