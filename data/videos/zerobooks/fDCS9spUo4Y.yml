title: 'Inside Zero Books #68: Oz on Syria and Assad'
description: "Oz Katerji is a writer, filmmaker and journalist with a focus on the
  Middle East. He is a foe of Bashar al-Assad and the guest on this weekâ€™s Inside
  Zero Books podcast. \n\nBefore the interview begins I want to make it clear that
  releasing this interview is not meant to be taken as support for US or UK military
  intervention or for US led regime change in Syria. It is, instead, an attempt to
  allow a vocal and passionate critic of Assad to be heard. Whatever the Anglophone
  left decides to do, whatever position or action we take, we should not hide from
  the character of the Assad regime."
