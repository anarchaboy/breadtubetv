  video picks apart the right-wing Day for Freedom video, examines how the alt-lite
  uses the Streisand Effect to spread its message, and points out that Karl Marx was
  a champion of free speech. \n\nAddendum: At 3:21 Milo is talking about when he was
  13 and was abused by older men. He is saying that he was the predator even though
  he was 13.\n\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/SubZeroBooks\nWatch the most popular Zero

  \nThe modern world is at an impasse. Disasters scroll across our smartphone screens
  and weâ€™re invited to like, follow or upvote, but critical thinking is harder and
  harder to find. Rather than connecting us in common struggle and debate, the internet
  has sped up and deepened a long-standing process of alienation and atomization.\nZer0
  Books wants to work against this trend."
