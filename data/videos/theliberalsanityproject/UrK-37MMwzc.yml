title: Kristi Winters and Kevin Logan Make The Left Look Bad
description: "How to lose friends and alienate people, ft. the left's biggest drama
  queens. \n\nTechnical error: Minor audio skip towards the end.\nCorrection: I state
  that Ralph was banned for hosting streams dedicated to Holocaust denial. Though
  primarily about Holocaust denial, the stream's purpose was to raise money for charity
  (the Heal Stream). \nNote: The stream ft. Jake/Kristi and Kevin/Warski were clipped
  and spliced for time. Links in descriptions.\n\nMy Twitter: https://twitter.com/LibSanityYT_\nMy
