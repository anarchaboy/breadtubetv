title: 'Socialism vs Capitalism: Why the Values of Society Assume Socialism'
description: "Socialism vs Capitalism: Why the Values of Society Assume Socialism\n\nIn
  the debate socialism vs capitalism, it mainly comes down to which system can best
  satisfy the values we hold dear. Since a socialist planed economy can focus on these
  values, it has more potential to satisfy these values. Therefore with socialism
  vs capitalism, the core assumptions of society come down on the socialist side of
  things. \n\nSources:\n\nEconomic development, political-economic system, and the
