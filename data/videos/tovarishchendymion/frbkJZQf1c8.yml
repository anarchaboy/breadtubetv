title: Anarcho-Capitalism Still Debunked
description: "Anarcho-Capitalism Still Debunked: Response to Hoodie Demon and Mike-the-Cat\n\nDebunking
  the debunking of \"Anarcho Capitalism Debunked\". Two Anarcho-capitalists made a
  response to my debunking video, however they have failed to grasp the main point.
  Anarcho Capitalism is a meme taken too far. Anarcho capitalism is still debunked,
  our ancaps used circular reasoning (Consumers won't fund syndicates because consumers
  are in control, therefore consumers will remain in control) or have failed to understand
  the main problem with anarcho capitalism.\n\nEven if we are to assume the core neo-classical
  assumptions of anarcho capitalism, it is still debunked. A state will form, perfect
  competition cannot sustain itself in an anarcho-capitalist society.\n\nLinks and
