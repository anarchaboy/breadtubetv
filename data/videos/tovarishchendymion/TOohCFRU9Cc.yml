title: The Strange Concept of Ownership
description: "Looking into what it really means to \"own\" something\n\nYou can hear
  my dogs playing and coughing in the background\n\nDiscord Server (pls dont join):
  https://discord.gg/KgUqmBr\n\nalso \nThis mailbox is mine\nAnd this triangular sign\nThat
  blue balloon\nThe month of June\nThey're mine, mine, mine, mine, mine\n\nZiggy's
  sweets are mine\nThat birdie's tweets are mine\nThe city streets\nBoth your feet\nThey're
  all emphatically mine\n\nIt all belongs to me\nEverything that I see\nNorth, south,
  east and west\nI caress it, 'cause I possess it\nI'm Stingy and it's mine\n\nAnd
  this instrumental break is also mine\n\nThe floor and ceiling are mine\nAll your
  feelings are mine\nYou always knew it\nThat's all there is to it\nIt's mine, mine,
  mine, mine, mine"
