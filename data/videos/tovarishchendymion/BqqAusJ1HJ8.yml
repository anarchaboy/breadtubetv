title: The Case for Ancap Stalinism
description: |-
  Satire of the great lengths ancaps go to in order to demonstrate capitalism is voluntary. Ancaps fail to understand the difference between radical and practical choices. We all technically have a choice to do anything, however in practicality, humans psychologically act in accordance to a hierarchy of needs of which is why we evolved. We are biologically bound to this hierarchy, making this "radical freedom" meaningless.

  TL;DR: it's a shitpost with a deeper meaning
