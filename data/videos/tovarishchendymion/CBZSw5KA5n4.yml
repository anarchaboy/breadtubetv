title: '3 Problems with the Non-Aggression Principle: N.A.P Capitalism Debunked'
description: "3 Problems with the Non-Aggression Principle (NAP).\n\nThe Non Aggression
  Principle (NAP) is based on idealism which presents a ton of problems for it. Adding
  the Non Aggression Principle to the definition of capitalism leaves us with absurd
  consequences. This video debunks the non aggression principle concept of capitalism
  because it depends on idealism. \n\nSuch problems for the Non Aggression Principle
  include\n*Obtaining Capitalism without changes within the physical\n*Ambiguity of
  aggression\n*Ambiguity of society \n\nA better definition would then be one rooted
  in the material and not the ideal. This video is refuting a specific type of capitalism
  that many anarcho capitalists and voluntarists believe. Dubbed \"non aggression
  principle capitalism\". It's not meant to debunk capitalism as a whole, just this
  specific type of \"non aggression principle\" capitalism.\n\nDavid Chalmers on P-zombies:
