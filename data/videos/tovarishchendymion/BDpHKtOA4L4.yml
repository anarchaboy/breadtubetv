title: '''Income inequality is Good'' Response to PragerU'
description: "\"Income inequality is good'.\n\nResponding to the 'Income Inequality
  is Good' video from PraguerU. I demonstrate why the claim \"income inequality is
  a good\" is absurd. PragerU's arguments in favor of income inequality are equally
  absurd and ignorant. I present studies from income inequality in America that demonstrate
  the harmful effects of income inequality. \n\nPragerU's defense of income inequality
  fails to understand what inequality of income means or entails. Along with totally
  misunderstanding what advocates of income equality argue."
