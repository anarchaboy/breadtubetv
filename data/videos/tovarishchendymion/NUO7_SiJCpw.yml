title: Food Shortages and Problems in the USSR
description: "Starvation and communism have become linked due to food shortages during
  the 1980s-1990s and during the 30s. Yet starvation under communism is simply a meme
  with no basis in reality. I refute the claims of constant starvation/food shortages/food
  problems within the USSR.\n\nFood shortages in the Soviet Union are explained by
  the problems with modernizing the economy (Kulak terrorism and the needed focus
  on heavy industry). Food shortages were not a constant problem for the USSR/Soviet
  Union. They were solved which gave rise to calorie consumption.\n\nAlong with showing
  starvation is better linked with capitalism. Starvation and food problems/shortages
  under the Soviet Union pale in comparison to starvation under capitalism\n\nLearn
