  “Debating the Cultural Revolution,” pp. 427-430. Gao, who participated in the Cultural
  Revolution, describes the impact of the new culture in villages like his: “The rural
  villagers, for the first time, organized theater troupes and put on performances
  that incorporated the contents and structure of the eight model Peking operas with
  local language and music. The villagers not only entertained themselves but also
  learned how to read and write by getting into the texts and plays. And they organized
  sports meets and held matches with other villages. All these activities gave the
  villagers an opportunity to meet, communicate, fall in love. These activities gave
  them a sense of discipline and organization and created a public sphere where meetings
  and communications went beyond the traditional household and village clans. This
  had never happened before and it has never happened since” (p. 428).\n\nLearn about

  \n\"She had been hospitalized for six months in North Korea and had heard China
  may have more advanced treatment. She assumed it would be free of charge, as it
  is in North Korea, where the state covers most expenses including housing, healthcare,
  and higher education.\"\n\"I was thinking of recovering completely before returning
  to my aging parents. I wanted to return home in healthy state. So I said I will
  go to South Korea for two months and earn the money and get myself treated.\"\n\nTwitter:
