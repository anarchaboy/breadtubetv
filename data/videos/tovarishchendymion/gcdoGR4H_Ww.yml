  Mussolini's Speech on Marxism Debunked

  Mussolini and his speech describes his reasons for rejecting Marxism, critical to his rise to power in Italy. His speech deals with an attack on historical materialism, class struggle, and the supposed "Hedonism" of Marxism.

  Mussolini and his fascist speech fails to understand basic Marxism. I explain the how Mussolini misses the point of historical materialism, why class collaboration is impossible, as well as his debunking his assumptions of hedonism.
