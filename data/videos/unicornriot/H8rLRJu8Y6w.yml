title: Independent Grassroots Media in Greece, OmniaTV
description: |-
  [CC - Greek, English] Operating voluntarily and organized horizontally, the grassroots independent media collective OmniaTV, has functioned out of necessity since 2011. Striving to bring out truths misrepresented in Greek media and covering under-reported stories, OmniaTV stands out as a viable alternative non-profit media source as for-profit and mainstream media controls the TV and radio in Greece.

  We sat down with Loukas Stamellos, one of the co-founders of OmniaTV and Ypopto Mousi (translated in English as the ‘Suspicious Beard’) and spoke with Omnia member Alex Litsardakis in Thessaloniki.
