title: Philando Castile Remembered Three Years After Being Killed by Police
description: |-
  Three years to the day after the police killing of Philando Castile, a 32-year-old school cafeteria worker, about 100 people gathered in remembrance. At the site of Castile's death in a St. Paul suburb, his family was joined by community members, activists, school teachers, children and elders, a Ramsey County Sheriff's Deputy and the Ramsey County Sheriff himself, Bob Fletcher.

  On the grass near the site of Philando Castile's death is a Peace Garden that has been tended for three years now, with flowers and a memorial. An array of newly laid flower art was created by artist group Flower Power. At the vigil, Valerie Castile, Philando's mother, thanked the crowd for coming and for supporting her during these last three years, saying that they've been the "inspiration" for her actions that include paying lunch debts and fighting for change in policing.
