  Mere hours before the Super Bowl LII kickoff, activists used lockboxes and U-locks to blockade a light rail station just blocks away from the Super Bowl venue, US Bank Stadium. The blockade opened space for Black folks to deliver demands, explain what ‘Black joy’ means to them, dance, and chat. 17 people were arrested, booked, and released with citations.
