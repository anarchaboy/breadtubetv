title: A Tour of Vio.Me., the Occupied Worker-Run Factory in Greece
description: |-
  [CC - Greek, English] Unicorn Riot brings you inside the worker-run and occupied Vio.Me. factory. We are guided through the facility by Nicole, a worker in the factory in one of our three part video series on Vio.Me.

  Workers have successfully self-managed the production of environmentally-friendly cleaning products for the last six years in the occupied factory Vio.Me. There are no bosses in this factory on the east side of Thessaloniki, Greece's second largest city.
