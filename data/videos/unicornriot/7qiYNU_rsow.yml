  On Saturday, August 4, 2018, weeks of far-right agitation culminated in a tense standoff between a few hundred supporters of the Patriot Prayer and several thousand anti-racist counter-protesters. Portland Police attacked the Patriot Prayer counter-protesters and shot dozens of 'less-lethal' crowd control munitions, one of which pierced through someone's helmet.
