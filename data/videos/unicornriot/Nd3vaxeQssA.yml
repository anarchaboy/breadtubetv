title: Anti-Racists Oppose Far-Right Rally in Portland
description: |-
  Tensions are high in Portland as a far-right rally, whose organizers have threatened violence, is opposed by large anti-racist counter-protests. A massive police presence has saturated the downtown rally area and city officials has told people to avoid the area. Unicorn Riot will be providing updates from on the ground throughout the day.

  Today's rallies are the latest in a years-long series of rallies by xenophobic groups like Patriot Prayer and the Proud Boys traveling to Portland to seek out confrontation. In spring 2017, Jeremy Christian, a white supremacist and frequent attendee of Patriot Prayer rallies, stabbed 3 people and killing 2, on a Portland public transit following an anti-Muslim outburst.
