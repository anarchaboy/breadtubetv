title: IoT Village Hacks Smart Devices at DEFCON 25
description: |-
  We dropped by the IoT Village at #DEFCON25 to see what devices they were hacking!
  "The Internet of things (IoT) is the inter-networking of physical devices, vehicles (also referred to as "connected devices" and "smart devices"), buildings, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity which enable these objects to collect and exchange data."
  Recorded 7/29/17 @ DEFCON 25
