title: Lentillères; Occupied Urban Gardens/Free District Stunts French Gentrification
description: |-
  Over a hundred anti-capitalists have created a nine hectare free district with urban gardens and a free market as they prevent development plans from being constructed in Dijon, France. The occupiers are seeking to preserve agricultural land and experiment in collective living while demonstrating horizontal forms of community building.

  Presenters from the self-managed Quartier Libre des Lentillères, or Free District of Lentillères, spoke at the Athens Polytechnic University in early June 2018, for the second Networks of Resistance-European Local Struggles Conference.
