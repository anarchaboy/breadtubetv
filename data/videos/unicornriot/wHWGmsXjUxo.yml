title: CO Activists Resist Frack Well Construction Near School
description: |-
  Greeley, CO - On March 8, 2018, local environmentalists and human rights activists went to the Extraction Oil & Gas construction site about 1,000 feet from Bella Romero Academy. Cullen Lobe took part in the non-violent direct action by attaching himself to a construction vehicle. According to the activists, if this site is completed, Bella Romero will become the most fracked school in the country because it is already surrounded by multiple fracking sites. Two weeks after the action, Lobe and other involved received word that they were getting sued by Extraction Oil & Gas.
