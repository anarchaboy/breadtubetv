title: Taos, NM Water Protectors Take Action for Water Rights
description: "Taos, NM: On Thursday, March 14, 2019, water protector Buck Johnston
  climbed to the top of the Midway Drill off Highway 64 and began a four-day vision
  quest and non-violent direct action. While Johnston was on top of the rig, a camp
  of fellow water protectors and supporters held space to further project their message
  of protecting the water. The local organization Guardians of Taos Water was the
  primary group maintaining the camp, and their reasoning was to shine light on the
  secret negotiations which implemented the potentially unlawful construction of deep-aquifer
  water drills in the Abeyta Water Rights Adjudication. The organization says if the
  parties involved in the Midway Drill do not voluntarily initiate a full and comprehensive
  Environmental Impact Statement, they will file an injunction in court. \nBuck Johnston
  descended from the 60-foot rig at about 10am on Sunday. He was allowed to get cleaned
  and comforted by family for five minutes before being taken into custody. He spent
  Sunday night in jail, but was bailed out early Monday morning. Johnston has been
  charged with criminal trespassing and obstructing a police officer. \n\nUnicorn
  Riot will continue to provide updates on this issue. \n\nIf you appreciate our alternative
