title: Eight Arrested During ‘Abolish ICE’ Protest at General Dynamics
description: |-
  On Friday, June 29, 2018, eight protesters were arrested after symbolically locking themselves in a set-up cage in front of General Dynamics in Bloomington, Minnesota. In a released statement by the arrestees, they stated their reasoning for targeting General Dynamics:

  "General Dynamics provides support services to the family separation and detention process. General Dynamics profits from the caging of children, and we demand that this despicable process ends now. We will not tolerate it. We stand here today because immigration is not a crime.”
