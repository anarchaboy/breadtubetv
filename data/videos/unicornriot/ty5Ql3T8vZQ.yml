title: Candlelight Vigil Honoring Brian Quinones Who Was Killed by Minnesota Police
description: "Brian Quinones was shot and killed by police after he exited his car
  with a short knife on Saturday night. Following a car pursuit across two Minneapolis
  suburbs, Quinones live streamed to Facebook while driving and captured audio of
  his death in the almost two-hour live stream.\n\nBrian Quinones was described by
  his family as a kind, loving person. He was Puerto Rican, a father to a 12-year-old,
  a barber, and an artist. \n\nQuinones went by Blessed The MC, and dropped a new
  album called T.I.M.E. (This Is My Everything) yesterday, the same day he was shot
  and killed by police.\n\nRead the full story here:\nhttps://unicornriot.ninja/2019/minnesota-police-kill-local-hip-hop-artist-after-pursuit/\n\nTo
