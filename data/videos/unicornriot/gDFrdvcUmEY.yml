  Police Attack #NoDAPL Water Protectors Defending Sacred Sites: On Wednesday morning, a group of water protectors attempted to cross the Cannonball to establish a prayer camp on the sacred hill near Cantapeta Creek. They built a wooden footbridge so that people could cross the water. Law enforcement responded to the footbridge by firing less-lethal projectiles at people attempting to cross, and SWAT officers in a boat tore the footbridge away with rope. Several people, including a journalist, said they were shot in the back by police with less-lethal rounds at point blank range â€“ medics reported that some of these individuals were coughing up blood from internal bleeding.
