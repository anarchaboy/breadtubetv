title: Anarchists & Police Clash in Exarcheia 10 Years After Police Killed Alexis
  Grigoropoulos
description: "Heavy clashes occurred on Thursday, December 6, 2018 between thousands
  of police and black-clad protesters on the 10-year anniversary of 15-year-old Alexis
  Grigoropoulos being killed by Greek police in Exarcheia.\n\nGreek riot police used
  many crowd control devices against the crowd, including water cannons, hundreds
  of tear gas canisters, and grenades, with some officers even throwing rocks at protesters.
  Ultimately, police sent at least three protesters to the hospital and injured dozens.
  The aggressive crowd lobbed massive amounts of molotov cocktails and other incendiary
  projectiles from the streets, and even from rooftops, as pitched battles stretched
  late into the evening. 66 were detained, 13 were arrested.\n\nMore info: https://unicornriot.ninja/2018/major-clashes-mark-10-years-since-greek-police-killing-of-15-year-old-alexis/\n\nSupport
