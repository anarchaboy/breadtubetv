title: '''Proud Boys'' Flee After Rally in Boulder'
description: |-
  The Proud Boys, an organization that has been referred to as “the alt-right’s weirdest new phenomenon“, held a “Free Speech” rally in Boulder, Colorado on Saturday, June 3. Members of the Proud Boys have been adamantly denying any racism, antisemitism, or homophobia as inherent to their group, however, several neo-Nazis living in Colorado, who frequently post on the Daily Stormer, “an American neo-Nazi and white supremacist news and commentary website,” were welcomed into the barricaded rally. One group of Proud Boys, who were later identified as being from Colorado Springs, started moving quickly down the street and were followed by kids on skateboards who were yelling "fuck you Nazis, get out of here," among other insults. The kids followed the group of Proud Boys through the parking garage and were joined by others when a confrontation ensued.
