  Icebreaker Pt. 6 – Leaked ICE Special Response Team Handbook for Planning and Executing Armed Raids
  Unicorn Riot obtained confidential Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) special agent policy manuals, which were in-effect during the agency’s earlier years under presidents Bush and Obama. Icebreaker Part 6 covers ICE’s “Special Response Team” (SRT) area of doctrine, the section of ICE organized along paramilitary lines.

  At 40 pages, the SRT handbook, dated November 20, 2005, covers how armed raids should be structured and managed by ICE personnel.

  The manual was published just prior to the reorganization within ICE of their Office of Investigations into the new, larger agency of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), and was official policy for at least 11 years, according to the 2016 version of the Special Agent Handbooks obtained by GovernmentAttic.org.
