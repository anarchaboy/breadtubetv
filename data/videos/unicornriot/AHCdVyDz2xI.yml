title: Twin Cities "Never Again" Action
description: "Unicorn Riot will be #live from the Twin Cities Never Again Action organized
  by Twin Cities Jewish & immigrant communities to oppose the #ConcentrationCamps.
  \n\nFrom event page, \"We can't wait for the right time, we needed to do this yesterday,
  and we need to do this together. Our cruel and racist immigration system impacts
  everyone living on this land, from the indigenous people who remember forced removal,
  to those of us brought here as slaves without our consent, and those who were immigrants
  and refugees fleeing oppression. This action is primarily organized by young Jews
  in solidarity with immigration justice movements locally and nationally because
  Never Again is Now.\""
