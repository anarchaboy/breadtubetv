  “It’s the biggest trial of Nazi organization since the Nuremberg trials. It goes completely underreported.” – Ypopto Mousi

  Journalists from the grassroots independent media collective OmniaTV shared with Unicorn Riot the importance of their coverage of the Golden Dawn trial.

  Golden Dawn is a neo-Nazi organization turned political party. They are on trial for creating a criminal organization that used ‘attack battalions’ across Athens to threaten, beat, and sometimes kill immigrants and anti-fascists.
