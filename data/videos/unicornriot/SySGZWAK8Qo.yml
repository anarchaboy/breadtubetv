title: Flash Drives For Freedom  Battles Censorship in North Korea at DEFCON 25 1
description: "\"In the worldâ€™s most closed society, flash drives are valuable tools
  of education and discovery. In a society without internet, with total government
  censorship, and with no independent media, North Koreans rely on these little pieces
  of plastic. Filled with films, books, and internet content, they are windows to
  the outside world.\" \n- Flash Drives for Freedom\nHuman Rights Foundation (@HRF)
  is a nonprofit that promotes freedom where it's most at risk. \nFor more information
