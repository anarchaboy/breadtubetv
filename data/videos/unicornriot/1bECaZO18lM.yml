  the Integral Cooperative of Heraklion (I.C. Her) has operated an autonomous open
  market out of the last bit of free space in the city, Georgiades Park. A network
  of self-organized projects with various local products meet once a month in public
  as a project of I.C. Her, which has started the creation of a new social structure
  and an autonomous economic system.\n\nA presenter from I.C. Her spoke at the Athens
  Polytechnic University in early June 2018, for the second Networks of Resistance-European
  Local Struggles Conference. \n\nFor more information: https://unicornriot.ninja/2018/heraklions-autonomous-open-market-generates-solidarity-economy/"
