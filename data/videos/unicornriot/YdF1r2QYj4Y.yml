title: Anti-Fascist Solidarity Fostered At NYC Extreme Metal Festival
description: |-
  2019 marked the USA's first anti-fascist extreme metal festival, "Black Flags Over Brooklyn." At the festival we interviewed anti-racist organizer Daryle Lamont Jenkins, founder of One People's Project, about how a metal scene open to everyone involves protecting the space from people advocating violence against marginalized groups.

  Punks & metalheads of all ages traveled to Brooklyn in January to attend the anti-NSBM music-fest and mini anarchist bookfair. Check out all the interviews and the full article on our website: https://unicornriot.ninja/2019/anti-fascist-solidarity-fostered-nyc-extreme-metal-festival/
