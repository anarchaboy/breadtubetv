title: International Volunteers of the Rojava Revolution
description: "The Democratic Federation of Northern Syria is an autonomous enclave
  experimenting with a radical form of democracy called Democratic Confederalism.
  The multicultural pluralistic system is centered around Direct Democracy, Women’s
  Liberation, and ecology.\n\nhttps://unicornriot.ninja/international-volunteers-of-the-rojava-revolution/\n\nIn
  2019, Unicorn Riot interviewed three New Yorkers who volunteered to fight alongside
  the Peoples’ Protection Units (YPG) and Syrian Democratic Forces against ISIS and
  Turkey. The documentary features their oral accounts overlaid with contributed footage
  from anonymous sources to bring you a first person point of view of what happened
  to fighters as they held the front line in defense of Rojava, an autonomous zone
  in northern Syria. The three men share their perspectives of what they witnessed
  while playing a small role in the Syrian Civil War as international volunteers for
  the YPG.\n\nViewer discretion advised: This film is not rated and contains strong
