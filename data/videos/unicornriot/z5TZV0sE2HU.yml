title: Riots Scorch Hamburg as G20 World Leaders Meet
description: |-
  Riots erupted throughout Hamburg as the G20 Summit met. Police water cannons were fired into the crowd trying to disperse the protest. The militant autonomous & anti-capitalist protesters used rocks, fireworks and bottles to keep the police lines back as the cannons swept the crowd knocking many to ground. Police beat people to the ground and kicked those that had already fallen. Individuals that were not saved by fellow protesters were dragged away by police through inches of broken glass that covered the cobblestone roads.
