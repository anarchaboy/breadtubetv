title: Anti-Trump protest in Minnesota [Part 2]
description: "Somali-American U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar (Minnesota) has been
  receiving death threats from Trump supporters over the past few weeks. These attacks
  are partially fueled by the President of the United States himself.  Supporters
  of Representative Ilhan Omar are holding a rally across the street from where Trump
  will be speaking in Minnesota.\n\nSupport non-profit independent media! \nhttps://unicornriot.ninja/support-our-work/\n\nUnicorn
