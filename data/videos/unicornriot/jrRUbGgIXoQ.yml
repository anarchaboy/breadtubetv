title: 'Welcome to Hell: #NoG20 Autonomous Anti Capitalist Action'
description: |-
  German police attacked the 10,000 deep 'Welcome 2 Hell' anti-capitalist demo before it could start. They split the group into fractions and violently beat people, used pepper spray, water cannons, and cs gas. Some people fought back by throwing bottles and fireworks. Our journalists suffered multiple injuries and a broken camera from the police's water cannons. We will be uploading amazing footage from the night's actions after we get some sleep. Thank you to everybody for your support and views.
