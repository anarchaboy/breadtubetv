title: Chile  At Least 50 Arrested in March for Free Education
description: "The Chilean student movement's latest national mobilization brought
  thousands of students to the streets of the capitol Santiago Wednesday. At least
  50 students were arrested, according to Terra. \n\nProtests blocked traffic in front
  of the presidential palace for more than two hours. Police special forces aggressively
  arrested protesters, many of whom were high school students. Some protesters fought
  back by lighting flaming barricades and throwing rocks. \n\nChilean students have
  been fighting for free, quality, K-12 and university education for 11 years. Though
  the the administration of current Chilean President Michelle Bachelet has begun
  implementing minor reforms, the Chilean student movement, CONFECH, continues to
  demand an overhaul of the constitution and the privatized education system put in
  place the former U.S. backed dictator Augusto Pinochet. \n\nCONFECH materials for
  the mobilizations were tagged #As√≠GanaChile: \"This is how Chile wins.\"  \n\nContributed
