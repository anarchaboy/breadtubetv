title: What is FairCoin? An Explanation by Theodore from Athens Integral Cooperative
description: |-
  Faircoin is a crypto-currency that is transforming the "block-chain" transactions to community currencies, said Theodore from the Athens Integral Cooperative. We interviewed Theodore about what Athens Integral is, how it modeled itself after the Integral Cooperatives of Spain, and how it plays a roll in creating an alternative economy in Athens, Greece. This is an excerpt of a longer interview and further examinations of alternatives to capitalism from our trip to Greece.
