  On June 14, 2018, the Coalition to End Unconstitutional Tax Foreclosures held a press conference near the new home of Sonja Bonnett's family. The coalition was celebrating both Bonnett's returning to home ownership after her prior home was illegally tax foreclosed and seized, as well as expressing determination and hope that roofs be put back over the heads of many more displaced Detroit families.
