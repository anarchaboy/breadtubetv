title: 'Move Along to Here: An Educational Fundraiser for Beloved Community Village'
description: "On December 15, 2017, the Colorado Village Collaborative (CVC) hosted
  an educational fundraiser to support the move of Denver's first tiny home village,
  Beloved Community Village, to its new location 200 feet away. The village, whose
  sponsor organization is the CVC, has to move every six months due to city codes.
