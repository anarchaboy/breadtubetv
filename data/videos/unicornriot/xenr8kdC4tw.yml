  On the first day of the 2018 Prison Strike, 50 people, alongside a marching band, shot fireworks off the Juvenile Detention Center (JDC) in Minneapolis while incarcerated youth looked down at the banners reading "End Prison Slavery", "Fire to the Prisons", and "Stillwater to Attica, Support Rebel Prisoners".
