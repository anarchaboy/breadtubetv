title: CO Community Holds Vigil at GEO ICE Facility
description: "Friday marks the summer solstice, which is the longest and often hottest
  day of the year, especially for those who are traveling through the dessert along
  the U.S.-Mexico border in search of relief in the United States. \n\nCommunity members
  in Colorado will be gathering outside the sole immigrant detention facility in the
  state to answer a call to action by the humanitarian aid organization No More Deaths/No
  MÃ¡s Muertes.\n\nMore info: https://unicornriot.ninja/2019/co-community-gathers-outside-geo-ice-facility-on-longest-day-of-year/\n\nSupport
