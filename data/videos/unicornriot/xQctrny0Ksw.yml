title: Interview with "Defend J20" Team Supporting Trump Inauguration Arrestees
description: |-
  Unicorn Riot spoke with some members of the "Defend J20" support crew to learn more about what has been going on in the first trial of people mass arrested at a protest against Trump's inauguration on January 20 (J20.) We heard from them about what has been revealed in court, what the case means for the future of protest organizing, how defendants have been impacted, and how people are organizing to provide support.
