title: The Third World is Not Poor, It's Being Robbed.
description: "How can the richest countries and continents in resources and people
  be impoverished? If your house gets broken into, who is to blame? Buy a burglar
  alarm in the form of Marxist-Leninist-Maoist class analysis and struggle. \n\nYou
  like what I do? You want to improve the production quality of my videos? You just
  want to show appreciation? Have some white guilt you want to absolve? Want to pay
  me for my emotional labor or whatever y'all tell yourselves? Venmo me at @BlackRedGuard
  or subscribe to my Patreon. \n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/blackredguard"
