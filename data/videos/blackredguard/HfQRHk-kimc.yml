title: Black August and the Importance of Applying Theory
description: "August is the longest and hottest month of the year. Thus, by rights,
  we New Afrikans are entitled to claim it for ourselves and a commemoration of our
  revolutionary history. This month saw the murder of our theoretician George Jackson
  (1971), the birth of Marcus Garvey (1887), the Nat Turner uprising (1831) and the
  beginning of the Haitian Revolution (1791). Learn to apply our theory so that we
  can make ever more history. Art by Kevin Rashid Johnson of the New Afrikan Black
  Panther Party - Prison Chapter. \n\nWant to support my comrades' work in STL? Check
