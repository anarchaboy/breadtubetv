title: Yes, Black people, we should read Marx.
description: Capitalism, imperialism, white supremacy. These are systems. They require
  a systematic, scientific method of critique and analysis to overthrow them. Without
  Marxism, the people have nothing. Do we want to win our liberation after 400 years
  of slavery and unrewarded toil, or don't we?
