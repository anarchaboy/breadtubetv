title: May Day Reportback, Kanye and Bill Cosby. (White People, Please Behave Yourselves)
description: May Day in STL 2018 was lit. Interleft, mass cookout and solidarity gathering
  at Tower Grove. Couple RGA fans (there's a local fan club called Red Path Collective,
  very nasty people) showed up, were made to leave after trying to start a fight.
  2018 is where white people so salty they can't make revolution try to attack black
  Communists while wearing Black Panther Party shirts. That's why you don't join cults.
  Also, fuck Kanye and Bill Cosby.
