description: "COINTELPRO was a government program that sought to destroy or subvert
  all radical and revolutionary activity in the United States. It took advantage of
  debates, line struggles, and disputes to destroy revolutionary organizations, get
  organizers like Bunchy Carter killed, and sow chaos. These tactics are still in
  use. \n\nAlso, buy a t-shirt or stickers and support the work of FTPSTL. \n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/ForThePeopleSTL"
