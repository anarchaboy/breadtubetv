title: What Can We Learn from Puerto Rico?
description: "The Puerto Rican people recently toppled a corrupt governor after the
  discovery of reactionary messages and behavior, along with general malfeasance on
  the part of him and his clique. Now, they seek to topple the financial mismanagers
  known as \"la junta\", or the Emergency Management and Oversight Board. What can
  we learn from them? \n\nhttps://thegrayzone.com/2019/07/28/puerto-rico-ousts-corrupt-governor-is-la-junta-next/"
