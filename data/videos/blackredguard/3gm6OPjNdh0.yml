title: A Few Words on Voting and other Inconsequential Issues.
description: Please stop calling yourself a Communist if your practice is to lead
  people to the polls. Trump is a paper tiger with a dangerous mass base that we'll
  have to fight in the streets. Clinton is a war criminal. Nobody gives a fuck about
  your third party candidate. Build power among the people instead.
