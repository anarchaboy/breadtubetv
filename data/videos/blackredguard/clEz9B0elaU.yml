title: Can a Revolution be Peaceful? When the Earth Falls to Pieces. (Thanks 2Pac)
description: "\"A revolution is not a dinner party, or writing an essay, or painting
  a picture, or doing embroidery; it cannot be so refined, so leisurely and gentle,
  so temperate, kind, courteous, restrained and magnanimous. A revolution is an insurrection,
  an act of violence by which one class overthrows another.\" - Mao Zedong\n\nAlso:
  1,500 Palestinian political prisoners have been on hunger strike since April 17th.
  Here's some information on their struggle and what they demand of you. Fuck Israel,
  long live Palestine. Support the Dignity Strike, support forces struggling for dignity,
  freedom, and Palestinian national liberation.\n\nhttp://samidoun.net/2017/04/1500-palestinian-prisoners-launch-largest-collective-hunger-strike-in-years-take-action-in-support/\n\nFrom
