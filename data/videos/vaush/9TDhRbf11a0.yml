title: Debate with The Distributist - Should we be Egalitarians?
description: "I think I said it over the course of this video, but I'll say it again.
  \n\nI overprepared.\n\nTo those curious, I am very comfortable with the rhetoric
  I employed against him. He's very clearly a bad faith actor who looks to take advantage
  of the civility of his opponents. When he realized he couldn't do that to me, he
  bailed.\n\nAlso, hurrah for my first real debate with a conservative public figure!\n\nTwitter
