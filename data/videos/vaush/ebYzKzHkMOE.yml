title: A Very Serious and Structured Take on the Hasan/Destiny Drama
description: |-
  Having watched the entirety of the debate between both of them since this stream aired, I now fall on the side of Destiny. I still like them both and don't want them to split - and I definitely disagree with plenty of what Destiny did in the context of this drama - but in this regard specifically, I relate heavily with Destiny's frustration.
