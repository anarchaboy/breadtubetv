title: The Quartering vs Big Joel - YouTube Mirror
description: |-
  This is a YouTube mirror of a recording of a debate which Big Joel had with reactionary YouTuber The Quartering, in which he bombed miserably but acquired some meager notoriety, as evidenced here: https://twitter.com/biggestjoel/status/1169316155468726272

  Big Joel enters around 22:20, before which Quartering mostly waffles about the Twitter thread Joel made about him, and remarks upon how he doesn't know who this guy is.

  The Quartering has ignored and blown off multiple requests from Big Joel to make the debate public on YouTube (https://twitter.com/biggestjoel/status/1173287295618899982) so I decided to rip the debate from Twitch and do the world a service by revealing it for all.

  For my regular subscribers, I'm currently working on my next actual video, which is about movies that feature climate change and/or environmentalism in their plots, and I anticipate that video to be out within 1-2 weeks.
