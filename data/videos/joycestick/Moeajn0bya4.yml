title: FLCL and Ignoring the Apocalypse | joyce-stick
description: |-
  An overlong rumination on my perception of Fooly Cooly's themes, put into perspective with regards to how they portray apocalyptic scenarios, and how these themes connect across all three parts-- all of which are good anime, in my humble opinion.

  Note that I misspoke and said HarukA instead of HarukO. It was too late to fix it by the time I caught that mistake. Please don't remind me.

  I agree with Miss Pedantic Romantic, and elected not to repeat her: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhlxHdIII3k

  I also have a twitter apparently https://twitter.com/joy_ce_stick

  I made a mistake in writing this video, not accounting for some official information out there. Goes to show how naively unexperienced at YouTube I am: https://twitter.com/joy_ce_stick/status/1087391157573828609

  MUSIC, COME ON!
