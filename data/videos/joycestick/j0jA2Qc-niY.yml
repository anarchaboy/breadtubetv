description: "Lots of people talk about Doki Doki Literature Club for its “deconstruction”
  of VNs or whatever… but it’s actually a modern Lovecraftian horror tale designed
  to resonate not only with the internet age, but the internet generation. And it’s
  not Just Monika.\n\nTranscript https://joycestick.wordpress.com/2019/04/13/lovecraft-empathy-and-doki-doki-literature-clubs-lonely-heart-transcript\n\nMonika

  Oh, you’re still here. Hi!\n\nSorry, this took a really, *really*! long time. I
  was working on an entirely different project for a bit and then came back to this
  after a while. I’ve been planning this since like… October. Went through about four,
  five? Revisions. I tweeted about it a bunch. And now I can stop tweeting because
  it’s done.\n\nBetween that, and being… more sad, more confused, more tired, more
  dysphoric, and more, generally… blah, it’s just been a real SICK two months. SICK.
  And, um, getting the voiced lines from kimmy also took a really long time. She was
  wonderful and working with her was fun, but I don’t think I’ll be having voices
  besides my own again for anything else any time soon, and I think she’d agree with
  that decision. Kind of just hit a cap on how much she was able to do. Which is why
  I had to get a tad creative with Sayori's voice in that one scene, given the circumstances.\n\nI’ll
  try to make sure that the next thing… whatever it is… takes a lot less time. Assuming
  I stay okay.\n\nThanks. xoxoxo, nyaaaaaa"
