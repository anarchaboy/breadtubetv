  Like manga artist ONE's previous work One Punch Man, Mob Psycho 100 features an overpowered protagonist unable to derive happiness from the thing that makes them "special."  But what does it mean to be special? And can such a label actually bring us happiness?? In this Wisecrack Edition, we'll explore Mob and the other Espers' inability to reconcile their exceptionalism with their desire to live a good life.
