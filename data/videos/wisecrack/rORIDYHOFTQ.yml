  Edition on The Philosophy of BoJack Horseman, exploring the dark existential undertones
  of this seemingly light-hearted cartoon. Behind the colorful animations and snarky
  one-liners is a show that's astonishingly deep – a series that ponders important
  philosophical questions about living life in a meaningless universe. From Pascal
  to Sartre, we'll dive into the thinkers and philosophies that are foundational to
  the show's underlying message.\n\n=== More TV Philosophy ===\nPhilosophy of RICK
