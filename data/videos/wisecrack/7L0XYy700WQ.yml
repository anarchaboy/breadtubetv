  to this special Wisecrack Edition on the must-know references in Rick and Morty.
  From Freddy Krueger to Zardoz, Rick and Morty pays homage to the imagery and themes
  of pop culture's most beloved properties – often inverting them to communicate something
  new. The more of these references you know and understand, the richer the show becomes!
  So what are the most important of these references? How do they elevate the show
  to new levels? Join us as we dive in! \n\nMASSIVE thanks to LAZERHAWK for once again
