  Sunny in Philadelphia. If traditional sitcoms are defined by progressive character
  development, saccharine moralism, and sentimental romance, then It’s Always Sunny
  in Philadelphia is unique in how it lampoons each of these tropes and presents us
  with an ensemble that deliberately avoids any sign of growth. Drawing from pioneering
  sitcoms like Cheers, Friends, and How I met your Mother, we’ll explore how Always
  Sunny isn’t just an anti-sitcom, it’s the perfect anti-sitcom.\n\n=== More Episodes!
