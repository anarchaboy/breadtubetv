  to this Wisecrack Edition on The Philosophy of Fallout 4, where we explore many
  of the political themes from previous installments, plus a new philosophical question
  with the introduction of Synths to the world of the wasteland: What does it mean
  to be human? Drawing from philosopher Donna Haraway’s essay “A Cyborg Manifesto,”
  we discuss the ramifications of how we define what is “human” – both in the Wasteland,
  and in our own world.\n\nGet the Game! ►► http://amzn.to/2gLgrg2\n\n=== More Episodes!
