  first three seasons of BoJack Horseman showed us a protagonist that, despite his
  Hollywoo success, struggled to find meaning. Season 4 departs from this narrative,
  to focus on... well, narrative. Join us on this Wisecrack Quick Take as we break

  backbone for the newest season of that show starring the horse from Horsin' Around.\n\n===
