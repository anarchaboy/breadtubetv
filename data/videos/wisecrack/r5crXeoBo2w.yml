  is True. Everything is Permitted.” If you’re an Assassin’s Creed fan like us, you’ve
  probably heard this phrase parroted by the Assassin’s Order numerous times. Does
  this motto reveal something essential about the Assassins' ideology? Or is it just
  deliberately cryptic nonsense? In this Wisecrack Edition, we dive in to the book
  from which the mantra was lifted, Vladimir Bartol’s 1939 novel Alamut, to explore
  how the philosophical backbone of this classic translated to the Assassin’s Creed
  franchise in a rather confusing manner. This questionable handling of philosophical
  material isn’t enough to hurt the games, but it ends up REALLY hurting the movie.
