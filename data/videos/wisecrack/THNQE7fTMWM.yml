  Although it seems like Billions leads Bobby Axelrod and Chuck Rhoades Jr. are moral opposites, their methods are quite similar. In this Wisecrack Edition, we’ll dive in to Game Theory and show how it not only informs the shady financial opportunism of billionaire Bobby Axelrod, but also the ruthless politicking of US Attorney Chuck Rhoades. Join us as we explore the metagames and multidimensional chess played by both Rhoades and Axelrod, and how it slowly erodes their moral compasses.
