  Award Winning South Park episode \"Margaritaiville.\" We'll explore how, through
  clever religious allegory, South Park crafts a multi-layered critique on the nature
  of power structures in our contemporary economic climate. By playfully positing
  that economics functions as a cryptic religion in its own right, South Park brilliantly
  satirize the financial crisis of 2008 – and the way people responded.\n\nNOTE: LegalZoom
