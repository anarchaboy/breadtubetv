  Runner is one of the richest sci-fi films in cinema history, so following up on
  such a classic is a daunting challenge. Luckily, the new anime that bridges Blade
  Runner and its forthcoming sequel flexes all the brains that made the original so
  legendary. On this Wisecrack Quick Take, we’re gonna break down the core symbolism
  and philosophical ideas of the original film and see how they also manifest in Shinichiro
  Watanabe’s new anime, Blade Runner Blackout 2022.\n\n\n=== More Wisecrack ===\nHidden
