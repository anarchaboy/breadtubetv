  to this special Wisecrack Edition on the Philosophy of Shia LaBeouf, exploring the
  motivations behind one of the most enigmatic actors and internet sensations around.
  After bouncing from one tabloid scandal to another, Shia LaBeouf emerged as an auteur
  of the bizarre with his #IAMSORRY installation – a performance art piece aimed at
  apologizing to the world with sincerity. Drawing from pop culture references like
  Deadpool, Spring Breakers and Brittney Spears, we dive headfirst into understanding
  how sincerity and apology works in a world of post-modern cynicism and disillusionment.\n\n===More
