  to this special Wisecrack Edition on Kanye West's Philosophy of Death. Mortality
  is clearly a recurring theme in Kanye's lyrics, videos and interviews. But is it

  proposed by Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard? Is this similarity a total coincidence
  or is there truly a comparison to be made between Kanye and Kierkegaard? We're here
  to find out! \n\n===More Episodes!===\nSOUTH PARK on RELIGION ► http://wscrk.com/SthPrkRWE\nPhilosophy
