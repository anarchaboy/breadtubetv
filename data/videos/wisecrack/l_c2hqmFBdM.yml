  its remarkable characters, unforgettable episodes, and surprisingly profound subjects.
  But the show is also exceptional in its ability to play with our expectations while
  employing rather traditional storytelling techniques. In this special Wisecrack
  Edition, we explore how Dan Harmon’s Universal Theory of Storytelling (effectively
  a variation of Joseph Campbell’s Monomyth / Hero’s Journey) helps bring the show’s
  dark and subversive themes to life. By following one of our favorite episodes –
  “The Ricks Must Be Crazy” – we dive into the structure and formula for crafting
  great stories.\n\nHuge thanks to LAZERHAWK for providing the music in this episode!
