  to this Wisecrack Edition on Batman v Superman: What Went Wrong? It’s no secret
  that BvS has drawn widespread ire for its issues with plot and tone. So, in an effort
  not to dwell on the same issues, we decided to focus on another problem plaguing
  the film: its ideological failings. Many of the film’s cues are taken straight from
  Frank Miller’s graphic novel The Dark Knight Returns – a work that paints a very
  clear philosophical divide between Batman and Superman. But it's in replicating
  this dynamic that BvS starts to flounder. By exploring some of Miller’s key inspirations,
  we’ll unveil how the philosophical backbone of The Dark Knight Returns was adapted
  to Batman v Superman – with lackluster results.\n\nSupport Wisecrack on Patreon!
