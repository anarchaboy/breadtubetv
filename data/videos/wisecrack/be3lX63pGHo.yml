  http://wscrk.com/PtrnWC\n\nWelcome to this special Wisecrack Edition on one of the
  most tragic films of the year: David Ayer’s Suicide Squad. Despite the fact that
  the movie was marred by critical changes at late stages of production, it still
  has signs of intellectual ambition. Join us as we look closely at the script’s thematic
  foundation and connect it to the other films of the DC Cinematic Universe. By tracing
  the theme of control through Man of Steel and Batman V. Superman, we can get a better
  understanding of what Suicide Squad was perhaps trying to achieve before the film
  was re-edited by the studio. Is it possible for us to still glean something insightful
  from a deeply flawed movie? With this new Wisecrack Edition format, we answer just
  that.\n\n==Get the Movie!==\nDigital Download ► http://amzn.to/2lEGfhT\nDVD/Blu-ray
