  ►► http://wscrk.com/PtrnWC\n\nWelcome to this special Wisecrack Edition on the Philosophy
  of Westworld, exploring how the show draws on one of humanity's oldest stories to
  explore how free will shapes our understanding of good and evil. Through the lens
  of the show's incredible cast of characters (Ford, William, The Man in Black, Arnold,
  Dolores, Bernard, and Maeve), we dive into themes of predestination, ethics, consciousness,
  and more, reflecting on how Westworld makes us think about the choices we make and
  how we live our own lives.\n\n==Watch the Show!==\nSeason 1  ► http://amzn.to/2mg6Bpr\n\n===
