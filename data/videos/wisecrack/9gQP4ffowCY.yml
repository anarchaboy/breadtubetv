  to this Wisecrack Edition on The Philosophy of Get Out. There are few films as clever
  in their depiction of racial tensions in America as Jordan Peele’s social thriller
  Get Out. While most movies that focus on race take aim at those who overtly try
  to disenfranchise minorities, Get Out does something unique: it explores how the
  demeanor of white liberals who have supposedly “moved beyond racism” may not be
  as authentic as they may think. By drawing on black thinkers and philosophers, we
  explore how Get Out is a masterful depiction of the black condition in 20th Century
  America.\n\n=== Get the Movie! ===\nDigital Download ► http://amzn.to/2pHg8rM\nDVD/Blu-ray
