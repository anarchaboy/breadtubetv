title: VIC BERGER IS MENTALLY ILL (My response to Gavin McInnes)
description: |-
  Gavin McInnes, the "founder" of Proud Boys, has hit rock bottom and has resorted to attacking ME in a series of videos. As usual, he is using intimidation tactics and libelous smears in an attempt to discredit me, rather than taking responsibility for his actions.

  Gavin has done this to many others in the past, and by publicizing my experience, I hope I can help prevent it from happening to someone else.

  An extremely thorough piece on Gavin that I hope you take the time to read: https://notvice.com/gavin-white-supremacy-article-agreement-page-160a4b5c9037
