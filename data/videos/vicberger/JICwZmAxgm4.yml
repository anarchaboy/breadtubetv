title: Jeb! Is A Mess (THE COMPLETE SAGA) and more!
description: "Since these videos were removed from the internet, I decided to put
  them all in one place. From Jeb's announcement speech declaring himself a candidate
  in the 2016 race to his sad exit. All of my GOP debate edits that I made for Super
  Deluxe are here as well as some bonus videos that were hardly seen or unreleased.\n\nIf
  you enjoy my videos and wish for to me continue doing what I do, please consider
