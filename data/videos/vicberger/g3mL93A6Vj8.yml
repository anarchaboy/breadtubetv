title: Rick Perry's Presidential Announcement (short version)
description: I watched Rick Perry's speech and really enjoyed it. My only complaint
  was that it was very, very long. To save people some time so they don't have to
  sit through the entire announcement, I made a short version of it with strictly
  the highlights. Watch this, and then go out and enjoy all the time I saved you!
