title: Peter Jackson's Tribute To Gregg Turkington (Prepared In Advance, But Gregg
  Failed)
description: Peter Jackson, director of The Hobbit, prematurely congratulated Gregg
  Turkington with this tribute video, thinking Gregg would be successful in watching
  500 movies in 500 days, but it seems he failed. So sad!
