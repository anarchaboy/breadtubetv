title: original therapy song - Gregg the OnCinema Buff (Come Back To Us)
description: |-
  Dealt with my grief for Gregg Turkington leaving the On Cinema show the only way I know how: through song. Maybe if he hears our pleas in song form, he'll consider coming back as a guest again.

  *LYRICS:
  Gregg the On-Cinema buff
  come back to us
  Gregg the On-Cinema buff
  please come back to us

  You've been away long enough
  and Ayaka doesn't know her stuff

  Gregg the On-Cinema buff
  come back to us
  Gregg the On-Cinema buff
  please come back to us
