title: Vic's Jeb Bush Neck Tattoo Covered By Channel 69
description: Jeb Bush made me get a neck tattoo. My story was covered nationally and
  now it was covered locally by Channel 69. I am burned out talking to the press about
  it and want my privacy so I declined to meet with this reporter. I just need to
  be alone with family. Jeb still hasn't contacted me. It's very upsetting.
