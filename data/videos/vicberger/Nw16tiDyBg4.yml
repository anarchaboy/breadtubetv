title: Epistle To Tim (On Cinema, On Friendship!)
description: "After seeing the finale of season three of On Cinema, I felt that Tim
  was a little uneasy when speaking about why his ladyfriend and guest, Ayaka, left
  the country, as well as the show. I think that he was afraid to admit the real reason
  for her departure, which may or may not have something to do with Gregg's copy of
  Airheads. This is a song written as an audio-letter to Tim in hope of revealing
  the truth. I think this gets to the bottom of it. \n\nI woke up one morning with
  this song in my head and I went right to the piano. A similar occurrence of this
  happened to Paul McCartney when he wrote the song \"Yesterday\".\n\n*LYRICS:\n\nI
  bet you're wondering what Ayaka's doing tonight\nIs she watching Airheads with her
  friends or with her mom and dad?\nI hope when she laughs she thinks of you and the
  times you had \nWatching Adam Sandler, Fraser and Buscemi on the big screen\n\nI
  bet you're wondering what Ayaka's doing tonight\nIs she cuddled up in Japan with
  another man?\nSome might call her a thief but maybe that's fair 'cause she stole
  your heart\nAnd the hardest part is thinking 'bout the films you saw together\n\nMost
  of the words she said\nYou couldn't comprehend   (that's what you claimed)\nAnd
  you blamed her leaving on immigration issues\nAnd you said she was a rebound after
  your marriage ended in divorce\nAnd you blamed it on cultural differences\nOr that
  she really wasn't the right woman for you\n\nMaybe she could'a been a buff\nShe
  could'a been a contender\n\nBut I bet you really broke it off for a certain friendship\nBecause
  that friendship ain't a VHS that can be erased\nI think you really broke it off
  for your On Cinema friendship\nBetween you and Gregg\n\nOh, on cinema, on cinema,
  on cinema\nOn friendship, friendship, friendship, cinema, friendship!\n\nNow I bet
  you know what Gregg is doing tonight\n\n(Credit to Oscar-winner Marlon Brando, the
  Oscar-snubbed cast of Airheads & Vin Diesel for their appearance in this video)"
