title: '#500Moviesin500Days (A Recorded Song for Gregg''s Future Record)'
description: "I created this song hoping that it would catch the ears of people and,
  in turn, catch their wallet in the form of a Kickstarter donation. Gregg Turkington
  of On Cinema is attempting to set a Guinness World Record by watching 500 movies
  within 500 days. He will be using the money raised to purchase movies, popcorn,
  parking & soda.\n\n*LYRICS:\n\nFive hundred movies in five hundred days\nHe's gonna
  watch 'em\nand rewind 'em \nGregg is paving the way\n\nFive hundred movies in five
  hundred days\nThe Guinness Record's on the line\nit's time to pay\n\nKickstarter
