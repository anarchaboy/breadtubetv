title: 'BREAKING: New Video PROVES Proud Boys ASSAULTED NYC Protesters'
description: |-
  “You ready?!? Let’s go, Boys!”

  NEWLY-RELEASED video proves, beyond any doubt, that Gavin McInnes’s gang sought out violence on protesters at his murder cosplay event in NYC On October 12, 2018. I synced FOUR separate camera angles of the assaults. Watch til the end to see NYPD officers turn a blind eye to Proud Boy violence. Also, McInnes’s gang members are seen bragging about assaulting protesters.
