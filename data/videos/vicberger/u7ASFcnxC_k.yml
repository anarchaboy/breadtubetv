title: The LOST Donald Trump Talk Show Pilot
description: |-
  Before the 2016 election, Donald Trump dreamed of having his own talk show geared to followers of his Twitter account. He made this pilot, but instead picking up a talk show on NBC, he unfortunately became president of the United States of America.

  I am proud to present to you, for the first time ever, Donald Trump's lost talk show pilot, "@realDonaldTrump: The Television Show."
