description: |-
  This is a #WalkAwayMarch highlights compilation featuring acoustic rocker JT Wild, standup comedian Terrence K. Williams, and a few other patriotic entertainers.

  The #WalkAway March was held October 27, 2018. The #WalkAway movement showcases stories of why Americans walk away from leftist ideology and the Democratic Party.

  The organizer, Brandon Straka, says he is pleased with an organized march last weekend in the nation’s capital and plans to take the idea on the road. “I thought it was spectacular. I am so proud of the entire weekend from beginning to end."
