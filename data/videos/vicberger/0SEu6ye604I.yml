  "My Reaction (In Song) To Episode 402 of On Cinema"
  Lyrics:
  I don't like what I'm seeing
  Critics shouldn't criticize their allies
  They should be only giving high-fives
  or a pat on the back for a good critique

  I don't like what I'm seeing
  Tension in the theater seats
  And the movie screen looks like it's about to scream
  because it hates to see two critics being mean

  Even if Tim's foot is in pain
  There's no need to call Gregg a name
  and vise versa
  Tim doesn't deserve a slap in the face
  Look at his diabetes and bandages
  He's not in a real good place

  I don't like what I'm seeing

  Tim, listen to your nephew
  Let that doctor stick you
  Let that Chinese needle take the pain away

  Gregg, think about your record
  Your Guinness World Record
  Don't let Tim attempt to throw you off your game

  He's going through a rough one
  I mean, he thought that talking squirrel was real

  so Gregg, well you got to be a loving buff
  Don't lash out at Tim

  Let his diabetes heal up and acupuncture take effect
  Don't let his swollen foot wreck the show

  When Tim and Gregg don't get along
  Hollywood cries a tear
