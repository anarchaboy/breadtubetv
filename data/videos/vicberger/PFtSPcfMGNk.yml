title: Ben Shapiro ABUSES Free Speech, CLAIMS No Responsibility For Mosque Shooting
description: |-
  Ben Shapiro went on Laura Ingraham's show to deny he had any influence on the Quebec City mosque shooter's views on Muslims. The mosque shooter was a Ben Shapiro superfan, checking his twitter feed obsessively in the weeks leading up to the shooting, as well as checking other anti-Islam, far-right and/or conspiracy theorist twitter feeds, including Laura Ingraham, herself. The shooter's radicalization from the anti-Muslim rhetoric of Ben Shapiro, Donald Trump and others, combined with mental instability as well as access to deadly weapons, culminated with the mosque shooting.
