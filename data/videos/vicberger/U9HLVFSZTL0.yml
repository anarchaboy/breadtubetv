title: The Fear Could Be Justified (Dan Aykroyd & Jeff "Skunk" Baxter)
description: |-
  This mini-documentary on the possibility of murderous extraterrestrials coming to earth uses the thoughts and words of Dan Aykroyd as well as concert performance clips. It also touches on Doobie Brother Jeff "Skunk" Baxter's interest in space exploration and the likelihood that earth will "wear out" one day.

  This video was compiled by Vic Berger using footage from the documentary, "Dan Aykroyd Unplugged on UFOs", and a few unknown sources.
