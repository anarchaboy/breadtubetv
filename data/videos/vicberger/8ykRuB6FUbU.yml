title: Message To My Twitter Followers Regarding Vines
description: Earlier today, I decided to take a monthlong break from making Chubby
  Checker Vines, Domenic Vines & Vines featuring the guy that throws himself into
  a pond. My twitter followers were unhappy with this decision, so I had to think
  it over. I've made my decision. Thank you.
