title: Vic Berger Presents Daytime TV & Advertising
description: |-
  If you don't watch daytime television, Ellen DeGeneres, Harry Connick Jr, Logan Paul, Steve Harvey and MORE show you what you're missing. This compilation also features creepy children's programming and commercials for products that may or may not actually help you.

  Individual videos in this were released on Super Deluxe, which is now defunct, so I am compiling many of my old videos and uploading onto my personal channel so everything isn't lost forever.
