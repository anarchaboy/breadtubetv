  Box comes the thundering roar of... YOU, our fans!!! The Patrons of Taco tier and
  above have spoken, and our chosen fate for this episode is Godzilla (1998) - one
  of the most anticipated and highly promoted movies of the 90's!\n\nHot off their
  Independence Day success, Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin were given the keys to
  the kingdom, and roughly $130 million dollars, to create their version of a modern
  Godzilla. \n\nBut the movie ended up with more mixed reviews than ticket sales at
  the summer box office. What went wrong? What went right? \n \n\nFollow us on Twitter:\nElisa
