title: 'We need to radically reorganise politics: George Monbiot in conversation with
  Verso Books'
description: 'In this interview George Monbiot explains some of the ideas behind his
  new book, Out of the Wreckage: A New Politics for an Age of Crisis. He argues that
  the "society-crushing system of neoliberalism has destroyed our natural capacity
  for altruism", and that we must fight against it to create "a politics of belonging
  that revives community and returns land to the people as a source of common wealth".
  We need meaningful participatory democracy, finer-grain involvement in politics,
  and power given back to people so that wealth isn''t continually distributed to
  the rich.'
