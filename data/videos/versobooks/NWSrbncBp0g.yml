description: "Raising Expectations (And Raising Hell)\nMy Decade Fighting for the
  Labor Movement\n\nby Jane McAlevey\n\nIn this engrossing recollection of her decade
  fighting around-the-clock for the labor movement, the charismatic Jane McAlevey
  draws on her experience and insight to ask what happened to the promise of labor
  reform following former AFL-CIO President John Sweeney's 1995 election—and what
  can be done to revitalize the movement we so desperately need. \n\nRaising Expectations
  argues that labor can be revived, but only if the movement acknowledges its mistakes
  and fully commits to deep organizing, participatory education, militancy, and an
  approach to workers and their communities that more resembles the campaigns of the
  1930s—in short, social movement unionism that involves raising workers' expectations
  (while raising hell)."
