title: “No, Socialism Isn’t Just More Government,” with Chris Maisano
description: "Part 4 of the “ABCs of Socialism” series, sponsored by Verso Books and
  Jacobin, featuring lectures and discussions with contributors of the “ABCs of Socialism”
  book.\n\nYou’ve probably seen the memes purporting to show just how socialist the
  United States already is by listing a bunch of government programs, services, and
  agencies. \n\nThe idea that any government activity is synonymous with socialism
  has major political and strategic implications. After all, if our country were already
  at least partly socialist, then all we would have to do is keep gradually expanding
  government. \n\nSimply electing politicians to office or watching the government
  expand by its own momentum has never been, and never will be, enough. Economic power
  is political power, and under capitalism the owners of capital will always have
  the capacity to undermine popular democracy—no matter who’s in Congress or the White
  House.\n\nAbout the speaker:\nChris Maisano is a contributing editor at Jacobin
  and a union staffer in New York.\n\n----\n\nView the other episodes in the “ABCs
