title: 'Omar Barghouti and Nyle Fort: Freedom-Fighting Under State Repression'
description: "Omar Barghouti in conversation with Nyle Fort, at Verso Books in Brooklyn,
  April 25, 2017.\n\nOmar Barghouti is a Palestinian human rights defender, cofounder
  of the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI)
  and the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. \n\nNyle
  Fort is a minister, organizer and PhD student in Religion and African American Studies
  at Princeton University. After supporting the growth of the Movement for Black Lives
  in Ferguson, MO in 2014, he went on a Dream Defenders delegation to Palestine as
  part of his commitment to global transformative justice.\n\nIn the context of increasing
  repression and political persecution of people are fighting for justice, from Palestine
  to the United States and beyond, Omar will discuss the past, present, and future
  of the BDS movement, its significance in this political moment and relationship
  to other social movements. Omar has recently faced a politically-charged arrest,
  detention and interrogation and a travel ban. Israeli politicians have advocated
  a threat of “targeted civil elimination”—a euphemism for civil assassination—for
  his role in the growing BDS movement.\n\nThis event will contextualize the struggle
  for Palestinian rights within the context of rising political persecution and the
  growth of intersectional movements for justice in this critical time.\n\nThe event
  was sponsored by the Palestinian BDS National Committee, Jewish Voice for Peace,
  Adalah-NY: the US Campaign for the Boycott of Israel, Tarab NYC, Enlace, Jews Say
  No!, PARCEO, Queers Against Israeli Apartheid, Muslim-Jewish Anti-Fascist Front,
  and HaterFreeNYC."
