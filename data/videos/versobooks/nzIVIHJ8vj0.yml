title: 'Getting to Zero Emissions: “In These Times” climate issue launch'
description: "Release party for “In These Times” magazine’s special issue on climate
  change. A panel of climate experts and organizers discuss what an equitable and
  democratic Green New Deal could look like, in New York City and beyond. \n\nThe
  Green New Deal offers, perhaps for the first time, an ambitious and potentially
  transformative framework for reaching zero emissions by 2030. Yet it’s only a framework,
  a set of goals and principles. This latest issue of “In These Times” aims to fill
  in that framework, inviting expert progressive thinkers to lay out each aspect of
  the political and economic change needed to achieve a just transition.\n\nThe panelists
  here address questions around the energy transition: What, concretely, will it take
  to wrest our economy off fossil fuels? After local wins such as New York City's
  recent Climate Mobilization Act, what can activists push for next? And, most importantly,
  is any of this possible under a grow-or-die, market-obsessed capitalist economy?\n\nFeaturing:\n\nKate
  Aronoff, fellow at the Type Media Center\n\nAshley Dawson, author of “Extreme Cities:
  The Peril and Promise of Urban Life in the Age of Climate Change” (Verso, 2017)\n\nPete
  Sikora, climate and inequality campaigns director at New York Communities for Change\n\nModerated
  by Jamie Tyberg, development director at New York Communities for Change and co-founder
  of the Democratic Socialists of America Ecosocialist Working Group.\n\nRecorded
  at Verso Books in Brooklyn on May 13, 2019."
