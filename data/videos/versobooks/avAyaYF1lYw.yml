  Eugene Victor Debs led the Socialist Party in the early twentieth century to federal and state office across the country, helped to pioneer a fighting union politics that organized all workers, and became the beloved figurehead of American radicalism. Imprisoned for speaking out against World War I, Debs ran for president from prison, receiving over one million votes. Debs’s story is the story of labor battles in industrializing America, of a socialist politics grown directly out of the Midwestern heartland, and of a distinctly American vision of socialism.

  This graphic biography, published in collaboration with the Democratic Socialists of America, is geared toward a new generation exploring socialist and working-class radicalism.

  “In addition to being a delightful biography of the railroad man from Terre Haute, this is a splendid genealogy of the struggles and ideas that energize today’s socialist revival. Buy an extra copy and turn on a friend or workmate.” —Mike Davis
