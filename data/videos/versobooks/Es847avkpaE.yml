title: Conversation on BYP100â€™s Agenda to Build Black Futures
description: "March 21, 2016, at Verso Books in Brooklyn\n\nBuilt on the legacies
  of slavery, Jim Crow segregation, housing discrimination, predatory lending practices,
  and mass criminalization, America's economic system has continued to systematically
  fail Black communities for generations.\n\nEnvisioned, written, and published by
  the young Black people of BYP100, the Agenda to Build Black Futures is a set of
  economic goals and structural changes that could improve the lives of Black people
  in the United States. What could reparations for chattel slavery look like in the
  21st century? What do reproductive justice, gender self-determination, and ending
  mass incarceration have to do with economic justice? Is any of this really possible?
  \n\nJoin BYP100, Dissent Magazine, Verso Books, New Economy Coalition, and Grasping
  at the Root for a panel discussion in conversation with the Agenda as we discuss
  what a multi-dimensional plan for Black economic justice could look like in the
  current moment.\n\nPanelists: \nJanae Bonsu, National Public Policy Chair, BYP100\nImani
  Brown, NYC Chapter Co-Chair, BYP100\nDarrick Hamilton, Professor of Economics and
  Urban Policy at the New School\nKeeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, author of From #BlackLivesMatter
  to Black Liberation\n\nThe conversation is moderated by Mychal Denzel Smith, author
  of Invisible Man, Got the Whole World Watching, forthcoming from Nation Books.\n\nRead
