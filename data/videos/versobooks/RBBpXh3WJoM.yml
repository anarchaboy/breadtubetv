title: By 2020 18% of children in the UK will be living in poverty
description: Already there are parts of the UK where up to 40% of children are being
  brought up in poverty. This has disastrous effects on their health, educational
  outcome, and chance for social mobility. We are living in an age with unprecedented
  levels of poverty. Who are the new poor? And what can we do about it? Stephen Armstrong
  answers these questions in his book, The New Poverty.
