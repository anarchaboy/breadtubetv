  Momentum has been building in support of Medicare-for-All in recent months, but the Left must be clear and realistic about the obstacles to enacting meaningful reform. We must ask: who are the powerful interests arrayed against Medicare-for-All, and how can we most effectively confront—and ultimately overcome—their opposition? To that end, we've assembled a panel of labor activists, healthcare professionals, and socialist political thinkers to shed light on the opposition to Medicare-for-all and to strategize about how to achieve a just and universal healthcare system.

  Join NYC-DSA for an evening of discussion and debate on these topics as we prepare for our campaign to make adequate healthcare a reality for working people all over the country.
