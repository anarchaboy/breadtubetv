title: 'The Beveridge report: where are we now?'
description: "We are living in an age with unprecedented levels of poverty. Who are
  the new poor? And what can we do about it? In this video Stephen Armstrong examines
  the 5 \"evils\" outlined in the original Beveridge report (which lead to the formation
  of the welfare state) and looks at where we are now. \n\nIn The New Poverty Stephen
  Armstrong travels across Britain to tell the stories of those who are most vulnerable.
  It is the story of an unreported Britain, abandoned by politicians and betrayed
  by the retreat of the welfare state."
