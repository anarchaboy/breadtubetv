title: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are the new Christopher Columbus | Raj Patel
description: '"The modern-day Christopher Columbus is someone who is very excited
  by colonialism and vast amounts of money. Someone who exploits their workers and
  depends on that historical layering of exploitation that runs from badly paid wage
  workers to slavery. Someone who is celebrated as a hero around the world. Someone
  like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk" - Raj Patel is the co-author of A History of the
  World in Seven Cheap Things: A Guide to Capitalism, Nature, and the Future of the
  Planet https://www.versobooks.com/books/2783-a-history-of-the-world-in-seven-cheap-things'
