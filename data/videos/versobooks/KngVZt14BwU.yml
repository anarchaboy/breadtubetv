title: 'The Fall That Wasn’t: A Decade Since the Financial Crisis'
description: |-
  With Astra Taylor, Sarah Jaffe, Ajay Singh Chaudhary, Rebecca Ariel Porte, and Raphaële Chappe.

  The 2008 financial crisis shook to the core not only the global economy, but also prevailing myths about the efficiency of markets, the possibility of endless profits and growth, and the inviolability of capitalism.

  Documentarian Astra Taylor and journalist Sarah Jaffe join BISR faculty Ajay Singh Chaudhary, Rebecca Ariel Porte, and Raphaële Chappe for a wide-ranging panel discussion of the causes and contexts of the crash, as well as its lasting, overwhelming consequences for policy, politics, and culture.

  Filmed at Verso Books in Brooklyn on September 27, 2018. Co-sponsored by the Brooklyn Institute for Social Research (BISR).
