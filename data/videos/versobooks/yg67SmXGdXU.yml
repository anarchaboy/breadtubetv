  FROM VERSO BOOKS:

  “The End of Policing,” by Alex S. Vitale: https://www.versobooks.com/books/2426-the-end-of-policing

  “Police: A Field Guide,” by David Correia and Tyler Wall: https://www.versobooks.com/books/2530-police

  What tools and language do we need to arm activists with in the struggle to dismantle the police state? How can we connect the struggles against police violence with the legacy of US colonial oppression and the militarization of borders? How can we link current policing practices as tools of social control to their racist origins?

  Join panelists Yasmina Price, David Correia, Tyler Wall, Alex Vitale, and tag for an in-depth discussion on the origins of modern policing, how the language of policing reinforces oppressive structures, and strategies for working toward police and prison abolition. We need to move beyond the limits of reform, in language and policy, to work across movements toward a society free from police violence and from police entirely.
