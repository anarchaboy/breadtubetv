title: “Is Socialism Just a Western, Eurocentric Concept?” with Nivedita Majumdar
description: "Part 3 of the “ABCs of Socialism” series, sponsored by Verso Books and
  Jacobin, featuring lectures and discussions with contributors of the “ABCs of Socialism”
  book.\n\nFilmed at Verso Books in Brooklyn, March 20, 2017.\n\nSocialism is in the
  air. But the idea of socialism also faces heavy counterattack—and not only from
  the Right. Within the Left itself, there is suspicion of an ideal many view as single-mindedly
  focused on economic issues and distant from other everyday sufferings, especially
  those of black and brown people. \n\nThe underlying assumption is that socialism,
  a supposedly Western (and white) ideology, while capable of addressing economic
  injustices, remains incapable of speaking to the lived experience of oppression
  and discrimination in the Global South, as well as oppressed groups elsewhere.\n\nIs
  there any validity in this criticism? \n\nAbout the speaker:\nNivedita Majumdar
  is an associate professor of English at John Jay College. She is the secretary of
  the Professional Staff Congress, the CUNY faculty and staff union.\n\n----\n\nView
