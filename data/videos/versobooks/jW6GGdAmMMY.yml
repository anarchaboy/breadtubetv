description: "Book launch for Samuel Stein’s “Capital City: Gentrification and the
  Real Estate State,” with Samuel Stein, Raquel Namuche, Rob Robinson, Shellyne Rodriguez
  and Esteban Girón.\n\nRecorded at Verso Books in Brooklyn, February 25, 2019.\n\n“Capital
  City: Gentrification and the Real Estate State” is published by Verso Books and
  Jacobin:\nhttps://www.versobooks.com/books/2870-capital-city\n\n---\n\nOur cities
  are changing. Global real estate is now a $217 trillion dollar industry, 36 times
  the value of all the gold ever mined. It makes up 60% of the world's assets, and
  the most powerful person in the world—the president of the United States—made his
  name as a landlord and real estate developer. \n\nAs Samuel Stein makes clear in
  his tightly argued book, it’s through the seemingly innocuous profession of city
  planners that we can best understand the transformations underway. Planners provide
  a window into the practical dynamics of urban change: the way the state uses and
  is used by organized capital, and the power of landlords and developers at every
  level of government. But crucially, planners also possess some of the powers we
  must leverage if we ever wish to reclaim our cities from real estate capital.\n\n---\n\nAbout
  the speakers: \n\nSamuel Stein studies geography at the Graduate Center of the City
  University of New York and teaches urban studies at Hunter College. His writing
  on planning politics been published by Jacobin, The Journal of Urban Affairs, Metropolitics,
  and many other magazines and journals. In addition to studying and teaching urban
  geography, he worked as a researcher, organizer, and planner on numerous New York
  City union campaigns, tenant mobilizations, and public policy initiatives.\n\nRaquel
  Namuche is a long-time tenant organizer.  Born in Peru and raised in Queens, she
  is an organizer with the Ridgewood Tenants Union, an independent tenant-led housing
  group she started in 2014.\n\nRob Robinson was a co-founder and member of the Leadership
  Committee of the Take Back the Land Movement and a staff volunteer at the National
  Economic and Social Rights Initiative (NESRI). He came into the land and housing
  movement after spending two years homeless on the streets of Miami and ten months
  in a New York City Homeless shelter.\n\nShellyne Rodriguez is a community organizer
  and a visual artist.  As an organizer, she is an active member of radical grassroots
  collective Take Back the Bronx, who agitate and organize for community control of
  land and housing. As an artist, her work is a decolonial baroque practice which
  utilizes text, drawing, painting, found materials, and sculpture to depict subjects
  and spaces in contention with subjugation.\n\nEsteban Girón is a member of the Crown
  Heights Tenant Union and serves on the board of Tenants PAC. He lives in Crown Heights
  with his husband Sean and his dog Chicochu, spending his days making life miserable
  for his landlord and the developers & politicians who are trying to empty his neighborhood
  of working-class people of color."
