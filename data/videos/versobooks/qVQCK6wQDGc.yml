title: Imperialism has moved up to infrastructure level | James Bridle
description: |-
  Internet fibre optic cables around the world trace out the routes of former empires. Cables from Africa route back to their former colonial powers. Lots of cabling from South America still goes back to Spain. Imperialism didnâ€™t stop with decolonisation: it just moved up to infrastructure level.

  In New Dark Age: Technology and the End of the Future leading artist and writer James Bridle surveys the history of art, technology, and information systems, and reveals the dark clouds that gather over our dreams of the digital sublime https://www.versobooks.com/books/2698-new-dark-age
