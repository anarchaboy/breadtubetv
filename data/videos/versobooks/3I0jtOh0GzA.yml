  Climate change is already exacerbating social and economic inequalities from the local to global scale. Big Energy and green capitalism are turning environmental destruction into an opportunity for profit—but their development of clean energy and transportation technologies also provides opportunities. What political strategies can prevent runaway climate change and eco-apartheid, and instead build an alternative future? Today, the most vibrant form of climate justice organizing centers on the frontline communities who are directly impacted by climate chaos and fossil capital. But this resistance must be paired with projects to develop alternative energy and resource economies. How can frontline communities ally in coalitions to meet this challenge? Which movements can consolidate a broader constituency of the poor and working class majorities that would be necessary for a just transition? In this panel discussion, Daniel Aldana Cohen, Ashley Dawson, Audrea Lim, and Thea N. Riofrancos will reflect on the current state of ecological crisis, and the challenges—and opportunities—it poses for building left climate politics for the 21st century.
