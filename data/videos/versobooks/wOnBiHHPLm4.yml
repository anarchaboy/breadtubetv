title: Changing the stories we have inherited from colonialism | Priyamvada Gopal
description: "Decolonising the English curriculum is about understanding and undoing
  mythologies. Priyamvada Gopal argues we need to challenge the idea that some cultures
  are the ‘givers’ and the ‘teachers’, and others are the ‘takers’ and the ‘taught’.
  We need access to other narratives. \n\nInsurgent Empire: Anticolonial Resistance
  and British Dissent is out now https://www.versobooks.com/books/2965-insurgent-empire\n\nPriyamvada
  Gopal is University Reader in Anglophone and Related Literatures in the Faculty
  of English at the University of Cambridge and Fellow Churchill College. She is the
  author of Literary Radicalism in India: Gender, Nation and the Transition to Independence
  and The Indian English Novel: Nation, History and Narration."
