title: Franco "Bifo" Berardi on the global Silicon Valley
description: "Renowned Italian theorist Franco “Bifo” Berardi discusses our current
  political impotence and the tool of humiliation in demoralizing and manipulating
  citizens, which helps to explain Trump’s victory and the power of figures like Nigel
  Farage. But rather than despair, Bifo argues that we should see in this humiliation
  the possibility of autonomy and eventually, communism. \n\nBerardi discusses the
  seemingly omnipresent Silicon Valley, arguing that whenever there is a hippie, a
  punk, an engineer, a rebel with a keyboard, the global Silicon Valley is there.
  Its ubiquitousness is our power. \n\nTo celebrate the publication of Bifo Berardi’s
  new book Futurability: The Age of Impotence and the Horizon of Possibility, we’re
  offering 40% off all books on our 'Horizon of Possibility' reading list. Sale ends
