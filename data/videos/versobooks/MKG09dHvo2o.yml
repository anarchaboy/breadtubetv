title: Building a Socialist Left Under Trump
description: "Sponsored by Democratic Socialists of America, International Socialist
  Organization and Solidarity.\n\nHosted at Verso Books in Brooklyn on January 27,
  2017.\n\nAs Trump enters the White House, millions of people are looking for a way
  to fight back against what is sure to be an all-out assault on the rights of women,
  people of color, the LGBTQ community, immigrants, and the working class as a whole.
  Our effectiveness in the struggle ahead requires clear strategy and tactics and
  a commitment to work together to cohere a strong socialist pole of attraction within
  the emerging movements against oppression and austerity.\n\nFollowing the historic
  national mass mobilizations taking place during the inauguration weekend, the Democratic
  Socialists of America, the International Socialist Organization and Solidarity invite
  you to join us for a comradely discussion and debate on the next steps for socialists
  in the Trump era.\n\nSPEAKERS:\n\nCharlie Post, a longtime socialist activist and
  an activist in the staff union at CUNY \n\nJen Roesch, organizer in the International
  Socialist Organization and frequent contributor to Socialist Worker, the International
  Socialist Review and Jacobin Magazine\n\nBhaskar Sunkara, vice chair of the Democratic
  Socialists of America and editor of Jacobin Magazine"
