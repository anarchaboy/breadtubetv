title: “Why Do Socialists Talk So Much About Workers?” with Vivek Chibber
description: "First in the “ABCs of Socialism” series, featuring lectures and discussions
  with contributors of the “ABCs of Socialism” book.\n\nMost people know that socialists
  place the working class at the center of their political vision. But why exactly?
  \n\nBecause workers are not only a social group that is systematically exploited,
  they are also the group best positioned to enact real change.\n\nVivek Chibber is
  a professor of sociology at New York University. His latest book is “Postcolonial
  Theory and the Specter of Capital.”\n\nFilmed at Verso Books in Brooklyn, March
  6, 2017.\n\n----\n\nThis is the first in the “ABCs of Socialism” series, sponsored
  by Verso Books and Jacobin.\n\nView the other episodes in the “ABCs of Socialism”
