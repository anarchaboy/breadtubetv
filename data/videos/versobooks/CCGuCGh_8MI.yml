  Bernie Sanders shocked the political establishment by winning 13 million votes and a majority of young voters in the 2016 Democratic primary. Since that upset, repeated polls have judged this democratic socialist to be the most popular politician in the United States. What lessons can be drawn from his surprising insurgent campaign?

  Recorded May 16, 2018, at the Borough of Manhattan Community College.

  Sponsored by Verso Books, Jacobin, and Fordham University Department of Social Science.
