title: The Queer Left
description: |-
  How has Marxism informed the struggles for queer liberation? And how have movements for the rights of sexual minorities changed the terrain of American society?

  Set 17 of the Verso Radical Thinkers series presents previously unpublished and out-of-print works of some of the pioneering contributions of queer—in this instance, gay and lesbian—leftists in the 1980s and 90s.

  The books in this set began the process of rethinking issues of sexuality and gender that has continued up to the present. While we have much fuller understanding of sexuality, gender and trans issues today, we should not forget the significance of the earlier contributions.

  Presentations by: Rebecca Ariel Porte, Jeffrey Escoffier, Amber Hollibaugh, Christopher Mitchell, Robert Owen Hawk, Max Fox, and Hector Lionel.

  Verso Radical Thinkers series, set 17—“American Homo,” “Come Together,” “Homosexuality: Power and Politics,” “Pink Triangles”:
