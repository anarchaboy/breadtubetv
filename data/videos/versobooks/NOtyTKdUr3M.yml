title: Conspiracy theories are the most powerful internet narratives of our time |
  James Bridle
description: "Conspiracy theories are a symptom of our new dark age. The last 100
  years of computation shows us that big data is always insufficient. We’ve completely
  undermined any trust in traditional sources of authority but we’ve also spent the
  last 50 years undercutting our understanding of the world by making technology and
  the systems around us ever more opaque.\n\nIn New Dark Age: Technology and the End
  of the Future leading artist and writer James Bridle surveys the history of art,
  technology, and information systems, and reveals the dark clouds that gather over
  our dreams of the digital sublime. \n\nNew Dark Age: Technology and the End of the
  Future is out now in paperback \nhttps://www.versobooks.com/books/2698-new-dark-age\n\n\"Like
  an Orwell of the computer age.\" - Kirkus\n\nJames Bridle is a literary editor,
  technologist, writer, journalist, and visual artist. He writes for Guardian, Observer,
  Wired, Frieze, Atlantic, and many other publications."
