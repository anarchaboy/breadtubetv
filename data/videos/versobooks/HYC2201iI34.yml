  \"Riot. Strike. Riot.: The New Era of Uprisings\": \n\nBaltimore. Ferguson. Tottenham.
  Clichy-sous-Bois. Oakland. Ours has become an “age of riots” as the struggle of
  people versus state and capital has taken to the streets. Award-winning poet and
  scholar Joshua Clover offers a new understanding of this present moment and its
  history. Rioting was the central form of protest in the seventeenth and eighteenth
  centuries, and was supplanted by the strike in the early nineteenth century. It
  returned to prominence in the 1970s, profoundly changed along with the coordinates
  of race and class.\n\nFrom early wage demands to recent social justice campaigns
  pursued through occupations and blockades, Clover connects these protests to the
  upheavals of a sclerotic economy in a state of moral collapse. Historical events
  such as the global economic crisis of 1973 and the decline of organized labor, viewed
  from the perspective of vast social transformations, are the proper context for
  understanding these eruptions of discontent. As social unrest against an unsustainable
  order continues to grow, this valuable history will help guide future antagonists
  in their struggles toward a revolutionary horizon.\n\nTranscript: \n\nRiots are
  coming, they are already here, more are on the way, no one doubts it. They deserve
  an adequate theory.\n\nA theory of riot is a theory of crisis. This is true at a
  vernacular and local level, in moments of shattered glass and fire, wherein riot
  is taken to be the irruption of a desperate situation, immiseration at its limit,
  the crisis of a given community or city, of a few hours or days. \n\nRegardless
  of perspective, riots have achieved an intransigent social centrality. Labor struggles
  have in the main been diminished to ragged defensive actions, while the riot features
  increasingly as the central figure of political antagonism, a specter leaping from
  insurrectionary debates to anxious governmental studies to glossy magazine covers.
  The names have become ordinal points of our time. The new era of riots has roots
  in Watts, Newark, Detroit; it passes through Tiananmen Square in 1989 and Los Angeles
  in 1992, arriving in the global present of São Paulo, Gezi Park, San Lázaro. The
  protorevolutionary riot of Tahrir Square, the nearly permanent riot of Exarcheia,
  the reactionary turn of Euromaidan. In the twilit core: Clichy-sous-Bois, Tottenham,
  Oakland, Ferguson, Baltimore. Too many to count.\n\nThe riot, the blockade, the
  barricade, the occupation. The commune. These are what we will see in the next five,
  fifteen, forty years."
