title: WAM!NYC Mentoring Session with Masha Gessen
description: |-
  WAM!NYC presents a mentoring session with journalist Masha Gessen, moderated by Martyna Starosta.

  Masha Gessen’s expertise on Vladimir Putin’s rule in Russia catapulted her to become one of the most lucid commentators on life under Trumpism. Armed with sharp analysis and a laconic sense of humor, Gessen regularly cuts through the noise of American media coverage.

  Gessen will share how she was able to do her job as a journalist in the context of a dangerous autocracy.

  Sponsored by the New York City chapter of WAM (Women, Action & the Media).

  Hosted by Verso Books in Brooklyn on January 15, 2017.
