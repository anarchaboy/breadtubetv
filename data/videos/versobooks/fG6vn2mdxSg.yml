title: The demonization of disabled people | Frances Ryan
description: |-
  In austerity Britain, disabled people have been recast as benefit cheats through dangerous and untrue media reporting. From social care to the benefits system, politicians and the media alike have made the case that Britain’s 12 million disabled people are nothing but a drain on the public purse.

  In this video, Dr Frances Ryan speaks to Sandra –  a woman with a spinal condition, living in chronic pain. Stuck in a cycle of being assessed, wrongfully rejected, and fighting tribunals, with devastating consequences.

  The social security system should be there to protect disabled people in times of need. Now, too often, it is the thing that pushes people over the edge.
