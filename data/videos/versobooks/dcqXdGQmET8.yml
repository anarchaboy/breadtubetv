title: 'Threads: From the Refugee Crisis - Kate Evans'
description: "Kate Evans discusses her new book Threads: From the Refugee Crisis,
  a work of visual reportage through the medium of comic-book storytelling - and makes
  a compelling case for the compassionate treatment of refugees and the free movement
  of peoples. \n\n\"We need to question why there are migrants, why it is happening,
  what is it about the state of the world which is displacing so many people. We need
  to question militarism, we need to be noticing climate change and the factor that
  it plays in wars as well as other forms of displacement.\n\"It blows apart this
  distinction between the economic migrant and political refugee, when you consider
  that large parts of the planet are becoming uninhabitable.\""
