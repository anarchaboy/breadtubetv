title: 'Four Futures: Life After Capitalism'
description: "Author Peter Frase in conversation with Alyssa Battistoni at Verso Books
  in Brooklyn, October 13, 2016.\n\nJoin Jacobin and Verso Books for the official
  launch of Jacobin Editor Peter Frase's Four Futures: Life After Capitalism.\n\nOne
  thing we can be certain of is that capitalism will end. Maybe not soon, but probably
  before too long; humanity has never before managed to craft an eternal social system,
  after all, and capitalism is a notably more precarious and volatile order than most
  of those that preceded it. The question, then, is what will come next?\n\nIn Four
  Futures, Frase imagines how this post-capitalist world might look, deploying the
  tools of both social science and speculative fiction to explore what communism,
  rentism and extermininsm might actually entail.\n\nCould the current rise of the
  real-life robocops usher in a world that resembles Ender's Game? And sure, communism
  will bring an end to material scarcities and inequalities of wealth—but there's
  no guarantee that social hierarchies, governed by an economy of \"likes,\" wouldn't
  rise to take their place. A whirlwind tour through science fiction, social theory
  and the new technologies are already shaping our lives, Four Futures is a balance
  sheet of the socialisms we may reach if a resurgent Left is successful, and the
  barbarisms we may be consigned to if those movements fail.\n\n—\n\nFour Futures
  is part of Verso's Jacobin series, featuring short interrogations of politics, economics,
  and culture from a socialist perspective. The books offer critical analysis and
  engagement with the history and ideas of the Left in an accessible format. \n\nMore
