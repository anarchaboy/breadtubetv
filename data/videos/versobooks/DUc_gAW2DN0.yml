title: Neoliberalism’s World Order
description: "Adam Tooze, Quinn Slobodian, and Atossa Araxia Abrahamian discuss neoliberalism,
  globalization, and the future of democracy.\n\nAt Verso Books in Brooklyn, September
  20, 2018.\n\nTen years after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers nearly shattered
  the global economy, basic questions about the worst economic crisis since the Great
  Depression remain unanswered. What drove the accumulation of private debt and financialization
  of the economy that made the downturn possible? Was this a crisis for neoliberalism?
  Given its association with globalization, is a defense of national sovereignty the
  only way to take back democratic control from neoliberal forces? How has this shaped
  the populist revolts now transforming the global order, and how might the left respond?\n\n---\n\nABOUT
  THE SPEAKERS:\n\nAdam Tooze is Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Professor of History
  at Columbia University, where he also directs the European Institute. He is author
  of “Crashed: How a Decade of Financial Crises Changed the World.”\n\nQuinn Slobodian
  is associate professor of history at Wellesley College. His most recent book is
  “Globalists: The End of Empire and the Birth of Neoliberalism.” Forthcoming is “Nine
  Lives of Neoliberalism” (Verso Books), co-edited with Dieter Plehwe and Philip Mirowski.
  He is currently writing a book with the working title “Hayek’s Bastards” on the
  neoliberal roots of the far right. \n\nThe conversation is moderated by Atossa Araxia
  Abrahamian, senior editor at the Nation and a contributing editor at Dissent."
