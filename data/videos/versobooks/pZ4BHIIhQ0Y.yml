title: 'Trump, Humiliation, Populism: Franco "Bifo" Berardi in conversation with Verso'
description: "Renowned Italian Marxist theorist and activist Franco “Bifo” Berardi
  discusses our current political impotence and the tool of humiliation in demoralizing
  and manipulating citizens, which helps to explain Trump’s victory and the power
  of figures like Nigel Farage. But rather than despair, Bifo argues that we should
  see in this humiliation the possibility of autonomy and eventually, communism. He
  maintains that we should emancipate from the superstition of waged labor and create
  a world where richness is for everyone. Whenever there is a hippie, a punk, an engineer,
  a rebel with a keyboard, the global silicon Valley is there. If we want to win the
  battle against the global corporations that are the real force of capitalism, it’s
  not politics that will help us, it’s not the nation state or political parties,
  it’s us.\n\nTo celebrate the publication of Bifo Berardi’s new book Futurability:
  The Age of Impotence and the Horizon of Possibility, we’re offering 40% off all
  books on our 'Horizon of Possibility' reading list, until July 23 at 23:59 UTC:
