title: Rejecting capitalist notions of freedom | Priyamvada Gopal
description: |-
  Some of the fiercest resistance to empire came from outside of Britain. In 1865, Jamaican rebels  challenged the limited 'freedom' offered by capitalism, being emancipated from slavery only to go work on sugar plantations as waged labourers. Priyamvada Gopal shows how the British tradition of anti-colonialism was heavily influenced by resistance from within the colonies.
