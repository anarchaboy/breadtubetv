title: Trump’s America and Anti-Fascist Organizing
description: "A flash panel to address the questions surrounding Donald Trump's election
  victory.\n\nFilmed at Verso Books in Brooklyn, November 9, 2016. \n\nPanel participants
  include:\n\nMuna Mire, writer and activist\nMaryam Jamshidi, founder and editor-in-chief
  of Muftah\nDonna Murch, Associate Professor of history at Rutgers University\nKen
  Chen, Executive Director of the Asian American Writers’ Workshop\nBhaskar Sunkara,
  founding editor of Jacobin Magazine\n\nModerated by John Nichols, National Affairs
  Correspondent at The Nation\n\nThe unthinkable has happened. Donald Trump’s bid
  for presidency is no longer a comedic farce but a political reality that should
  not be underestimated or taken lightly. This political upset represents a catastrophic
  blow to working class women, communities of color, immigrants, Muslims, and LGBTQ
  populations.\n\nWhere do we go from here? What can we do right now to organize for
  the most vulnerable? What political forces can we muster to challenge the Trump
  administration? And how does this election relate to the global shift to the right
  and the rise of fascism at home?"
