title: “Threads” book launch and discussion on the refugee crisis
description: "Join Verso Books, Muftah, and the Brooklyn Institute for Social Research
  for the launch of Kate Evans’s new graphic novel, “Threads: From the Refugee Crisis”
  and a wide-ranging discussion on the refugee crisis in Syria and the Middle East.\n\nEvans
  volunteered at the refugee camp in Calais, France, also known as “The Jungle” in
  late 2015/early 2016 and recounts the stories of many of the people she met there,
  all while arguing for the compassionate treatment of refugees and the free movement
  of peoples.\n\nEvans is joined in conversation by journalist and Syrian rights activist
  Loubna Mrie, Maryam Jamshidi of Muftah.org, and Anthony Alessandrini of the Brooklyn
  Institute for Social Research.\n\nThey discuss the wider context of the civil war
  in Syria, Western media portrayals of the refugee crisis, and the role of the US
  War on Terror in exacerbating the forced migration of people from war torn regions.
  \n\nFilmed at Verso Books in Brooklyn on September 19, 2017.\n\n“Threads: From The
  Refugee Crisis” is available from Verso Books:\nhttps://www.versobooks.com/books/2458-threads\n\n----\n\nAbout

  launched in May 2010 to provide English-speaking audiences with incisive analysis
  on countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) that eschewed the Western
  media’s focus on terrorism, oil, and Islamism, and highlighted the complex factors
  that shape and influence regional countries and populations. Since then, we have
  extended our coverage to Central Asia and Eastern Europe, and plan to keep expanding
  to other parts of the globe that are similarly misunderstood and misrepresented
  by mainstream media outlets.\n\nThe Brooklyn Institute for Social Research is an
  interdisciplinary teaching and research institute that offers critical, community-based
  education in the humanities and social sciences. Working in partnership with local
  businesses and cultural organizations, we integrate rigorous but accessible scholarly
  study with the everyday lives of working adults and re-imagine scholarship for the
  21st century."
