title: 'Free (Speech) Palestine: Writers Talk about BDS and Beyond'
description: "Sarah Schulman, Susan Abulhawa, Aja Monet and Radhika Sainath at Verso
  Books in Brooklyn, September 18, 2017.\n\nJoin writers Susan Abulhawa and Sarah
  Schulman, poet Aja Monet, and legal expert Radhika Sainath as they discuss the repression
  of Palestinian cultural production as well as the increasingly harsh attempts here
  in the United States to silence criticism of Israeli government policies.\n\n“Free
  (Speech) Palestine” continues the conversation about solidarity and the role of
  the artist that was sparked by the campaign calling on PEN America to reject Israeli
  government sponsorship for its World Voices Festival. The evening’s conversation
  will address the conditions under which Palestinian artists labor, the Palestinian
  call for the cultural boycott of Israel, and efforts to criminalize BDS (boycott,
  divestment, and sanctions) in the United States.\n\nOrganized by Adalah-NY: Campaign
  for the Boycott of Israel and Jewish Voice for Peace: Arts & Culture.\n\nCosponsored
  by Haymarket Books, Just World Books, OR Books, Palestine Festival of Literature,
  and Verso Books.\n\nAbout the participants:\n\nSUSAN ABULHAWA is a novelist, political
  commentator, and social justice activist. She was born to refugees of the 1967 War,
  in which Israel captured what remained of Palestine. Her debut novel “Mornings in
