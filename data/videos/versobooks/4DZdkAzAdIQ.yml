  “Mistaken Identity: Race and Class in the Age of Trump” is available from Verso Books: https://www.versobooks.com/books/2716-mistaken-identity

  Whether class or race is the more important factor in modern politics is a question right at the heart of recent history’s most contentious debates. Among groups who should readily find common ground, there is little agreement. To escape this deadlock, Asad Haider turns to the rich legacies of the black freedom struggle.

  Drawing on the words and deeds of black revolutionary theorists, he argues that identity politics is not synonymous with anti-racism, but instead amounts to the neutralization of its movements. It marks a retreat from the crucial passage of identity to solidarity, and from individual recognition to the collective struggle against an oppressive social structure. Weaving together autobiographical reflection, historical analysis, theoretical exegesis, and protest reportage, “Mistaken Identity” is a passionate call for a new practice of politics beyond colorblind chauvinism and “the ideology of race.”
